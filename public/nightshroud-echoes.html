<p align="center">Introduction Arc</p>

<p>The evening sunlight cast a warm glow, illuminating the farmlands surrounding the city of Ansphin. Cradled between the swaying cornstalks was a train station. The station looked almost forgotten, except for the waiting train, its steel body glittering in the sun. Kieran leaned against the train car, watching the workers load the last few crates into the train. </p>

<p>The crest on the crate glittered, catching the sunlight. It was the crest of Kieran's family, who managed the food supplies. A speaker crackled to life, announcing the closing time of the train station. He just had to confirm everything was loaded, before he could finally head home. He just needed to check if his sister, Kiara was done with her work.</p>

<p>Kieran let his gaze drift around the golden farmlands, watching the cornstalks sway in the breeze. The city had no place like this, only endless metal, and stone all around. The farmlands stretched on for a bit, before abruptly being cut off by a barrier. A few years back, Kieran had tried checking what was out there, but all he could find was a barren wasteland. He wandered around for a bit, till a loud roar shattered the silence, convincing him to turn back.</p>

<p>There were some people having some strange powers, who could survive the wasteland, but they were very elusive, and rarely appeared in public. Kieran wanted to join them so bad, but he did not possess any powers at all as far as he knew, and neither did his sister.</p>

<p>Kieran sighed, shaking himself from his thoughts. The boxes were done being loaded. Turning away from the train station, Kieran headed to a small office that was built right next to it. This was where his sister handled the payments.</p>

<p>Kiara was just finishing up when Kieran walked in. Stacks of paper were present on the desk she was seated, scattered along with a bunch of stamps and pens. A small group of farmers were waiting, seated on the chairs that were present in the office.</p>

<p>"Are you done with your work?" asked Kiara, casually signing some documents that was handed over to her by the farmers.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it just got over" replied Kieran. "Just get the payments settled, and we can head back home. I am so tired, and I want to catch up with that new show that was supposed to release today."</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, just a bit more." Said Kiara. "Oh, the show is releasing today, right? Almost forgot about that, we shall watch it together when we get back."</p>

<p>Kiara slowly finished up the payments, and Kieran started walking towards the train station. Right when he was about to reach the train station, a sharp flash of light interrupted his vision. It seemed to come from a bit further ahead into the farmlands.</p>

<p>"Did you see that too, Kia?" asked Kieran, turning around.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I did" said Kiara, who had been walking a bit behind him, looking up something on her phone. "Do you want to go check it out?" </p>

<p>"How do to plan to get back home then?" said Kieran. "The train will be leaving soon, and it's a long walk to the city from this far out."</p>

<p>"It's fine, we can just stay at an inn here till the morning train." said Kiara. "Just inform the workers, and we shall go check it out."</p>

<p>After Kieran was done with the final checks, he and his sister watched as the train slowly departed the station, loaded to the brim with food. The train slowly grew smaller and smaller as it disappeared beyond the horizon, heading straight to Ansphin city, where the food was sold. The sky had completely turned dark, and the landscape before Kieran was lit only by the silver glimmer of moonlight.</p>

<p>One good thing about the darkness was that it made it easy to spot light flashes. Kieran barely had to wait before there was another flash of light coming from the general direction of the previous flash.</p>

<p>Kiara, who was scanning the environment intently, quickly started running towards the flash of light "Hurry up, we need to catch up before they leave"</p>

<p>Kieran started running after his sister. He wasn't sure if the flashes were anything that important, but he did want to check it out in case it was something interesting. There was a semi forested area, and it looked like they had to cross it to get there.</p>

<p>"Imagine it is just some random farmer and his torchlight" said Kieran, taking out his phone to check the map. "It looks like we are nearly at the barrier"</p>

<p>"Come on, where is your sense of adventure" Kiara nudged Kieran with her elbow. "There is no way a farmer's torch can make flashes like that"</p>

<p>"We shall see for ourselves soon enough I guess"</p>

<p>As they kept running, the trees slowly started thinning. Ahead of him, Kieran could see a small clearing come into view. </p>

<p>"We need to walk carefully from now on" said Kieran, slowing his pace to reduce the noise that he made. "We don't want to alert whoever or whatever is there"</p>

<p>Kiara nodded, carefully looking around her. "Are we still within the barrier, or did we cross it?"</p>

<p>"We are still inside the barrier," said Kieran. "The barrier is just past that clearing according to this map."</p>

<p>Carefully making sure to stay hidden under the shadows cast by the trees, Kieran and his sister slipped through the trees, their footsteps muffled by the undergrowth. The clearing ahead was bathed in glowing moonlight, straight out of a fairytale.</p>

<p>Right in the middle of the clearing was a lone figure, barely visible, even with the moonlight. They definitely were not a farmer, as far as Kieran could tell. The figure did not move, as if waiting for something to happen. A few seconds later, a creature blinked into existence, heading straight for the lone figure.</p>

<p>Kieran froze, turning sharply to Kiara. "That's bad, we need to get away from here before it notices us"</p>

<p>"Yeah, we need to report this once we get back. I did not know the creatures could cross the barrier"</p>

<p>Kieran grabbed his sister, and just when he was about to start running, a feminine voice floated towards him like a warm summer's rain.</p>

<p>"You guys are not as hidden as you think you are, you know," said the girl. Kieran turned towards the clearing, watching the girl slowly walk towards him. The monster was nowhere to be seen. Did she defeat the monster all on her own? Kieran had no clue. At least they did not have to worry about the monster anymore.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Kieran, staring at the girl, who was now close enough to be visible. Her face was still partially covered by her hoodie. He was not sure if they could trust her, but all he could do in the moment was to keep the conversation going, and slowly plan his retreat.</p>

<p>In response, the girl lowered her hoodie, letting locks of brown hair spill past her shoulders. As her face was fully revealed, Kieran found himself momentarily taken aback. She really was cute, with striking features that suited her confidence.</p>

<p>"I am Elena, one of the members of the Eclipse Seekers, Division 5"</p>

<p>"And what about the monster you just fought?" asked Kiara, looking around the clearing for any signs of ambush.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about that," said Elena. "It's just a manifestation of my power, and won't harm anyone."</p>

<p>"That means you guys are from the group which my brother Kieran wanted to join" Kiara turned to Kieran and smirked. "Unfortunately, he does not have any powers, and neither do I."</p>

<p>"Wait a second, did you just say Kieran? Is your name Kiara by any chance?"</p>

<p>Kiara's surprise was visible on her face. Kieran had no idea how did someone from a mysterious group knew their names.</p>

<p>"Yes, my name is Kiara, and that's Kieran" replied Kiara, with a guarded voice. "How do you even know about us anyway?"</p>

<p>"Uhm, this is bit of a secret, and I am sure I will get into trouble for telling you guys this, but you were actually on the list to be recruited into our organization. Elena stared at the ground, seemingly lost in thought. "I don't know the full story as I am a relatively new member myself but yeah, you guys are meant to be with us."</p>

<p>"So, you are saying we have powers then?" said Kieran. There was no way he had any powers. When he was younger, he wished desperately to be able to go beyond the barrier and do something useful for the city, but as he grew older, he realized that nothing can change the fact that he is powerless, so he had cast away his dreams.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it is just dormant, and can be awakened," said Elena. "Actually, it seems like majority of the population have the power, but it is usually too weak to even be of use for most people. Anyway, I should get you guys to our headquarters, before the other organizations try to recruit you."</p>

<p>"Why have we not been contacted by other organizations at all? Asked Kiara.</p>

<p>His sister was right. Kieran had never been contacted by anyone claiming to have powers like this at all.</p>

<p>"No clue," replied Elena. "I just heard that all organizations falling under the Eclipse Seekers were banned from ever contacting you."</p>

<p>"Ah you are going to be in huge trouble then" said Kiara, displaying a warm smile. "Shall we go with Elena and see what happens, Kieran?"</p>

<p>Kieran could not think of any objections. He wanted to get the full truth behind whatever is happening, and he knew the only way for that was to go along with Elena, and question the organization directly. "Not like you are going to listen if I say otherwise Kia"</p>

<p>"You are right about that!" laughed Kiara, heading after Elena. </p>

<p>Kieran hesitated a bit before stepping forward. There was no turning back now, he needed to know how to use his powers, that was his dream after all.</p>

<p>   </p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER 2</p>

<p>"Hey Elena, how do you plan to get back to your headquarters?" asked Kieran. "Going to the city is impossible this late at night"</p>

<p>"Our headquarters is pretty close by actually," said Elena. "It should be about an hour of walking from here"</p>

<p>"No way, if it was located here, we would have definitely seen it," said Kiara. "We come here every week to load supplies from different parts of the farmlands."</p>

<p>"You will be surprised" Elena smiled. "Come, it's just a little further now"</p>

<p>Kieran slowly made his way towards the location of the headquarters following Elena. He had no idea how a set of buildings can be hidden that easily. Kieran could not see anything resembling any headquarters. Verdant horizons stretched endlessly before him, lit by the silver moonlight. It had been nearly an hour since they started walking, and they did not reach anything yet.</p>

<p>Kiara turned back towards Kieran, giving him a questioning look. "I am pretty sure we have come in this general location, and absolutely nothing was here."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I wonder how they hide their headquarters"</p>

<p>"We have reached the headquarters" announced Elena. "Now watch me carefully as I show you the entrance."</p>

<p>Elena stepped forward, resting her hands against an invisible wall. Kieran tried walking towards the wall, but Elena extended her hand towards him, blocking his way.</p>

<p>"Don't do that" warned Elena. "It's an illusion barrier, which will confuse your sense of surroundings, if you are not integrated with a Nightshroud crystal."</p>

<p>Kieran jumped back, keeping a healthy distance from the barrier. Elena walked around for a while, till she stopped in her tracks, her hands still on the barrier.</p>

<p>"Found the switch," said Elena, flipping the switch. "This will disable the barrier, so that you two can come inside"</p>

<p>The entire barrier rippled, and slowly faded out of existence. An entire sea of buildings stood in the place where previously there was nothing. It was a sight to behold indeed. Kieran could not see anyone nearby currently. The entire place was lit up by soft yellow street lights, similar to the ones in the city. Kiara similarly was staring at the city in surprise.</p>

<p>"Welcome to The Eclipse Seekers!" said Elena, giving Kieran and his sister a proud smile. "How do you like it?"</p>

<p>"I did not expect this at all," said Kiara. "I though you would take a portal or something to the headquarter."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, no one knows how to make portal anymore," said Elena. "The ones in the city are just linked to the few cities near us, as you might know."</p>

<p>Kieran had seen the 4 portals that people used to travel between the linked cities, but he and Kiara were not allowed to travel outside the city by their parents.</p>

<p>"Now what do we do? Asked Kieran. "This place is barely guarded for such a secret headquarter."</p>

<p>"That is how much they trust the barrier," said Elena. "I shall put it back up, and we shall head to my accommodation for the night. I don't want to get yelled at by the leaders right now, so we shall deal with it tomorrow."</p>

<p>Kieran would have normally hesitated going to a girl's room this late at night but thankfully, his sister was there to prevent any awkwardness. Noticing the look on his face, Kiara turned towards him. He instantly realised that Kiara being here was the worst possible thing to happen.</p>

<p>"Feeling shy are we, Kieran?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, nothing like that" Kieran casually moved beside Kiara, pulling her away from Elena. "It's getting late, we need to be well rested before tomorrow"</p>

<p>Elena, who was watching the exchange just smiled. "Kieran is right, let's get going!"</p>

<p>Elena started heading towards her house. Kieran turned towards his sister and whispered. "I shall get you back for that, you wait"</p>

<p>Laughing, Kiara started walking towards Elena, leaving Kieran to slowly take in the sights of the city. There were many different buildings located there, and many of them were residential buildings. The main feature of the area was the guild headquarters, which Kieran could see in the distance. It stretched above the other buildings, standing tall amidst the smaller buildings.</p>

<p>After a short walk, Elena stopped in front of a small building. It was a small apartment style building. </p>

<p>"Here we are," said Elena. "Make yourselves at home"</p>

<p>"Damn, its much bigger than I expected," said Kieran, taking a quick look at the building. It looked old, but also cozy in a sense.</p>

<p>"Even new recruits get houses like this?" continued Kiara.</p>

<p>"Yeah, since we barely have any members," said Elena, as she entered her house, and switched on the lights. A warm glow illuminated the space as light flooded the area. The apartment consisted of a living room, with a small bedroom at the side. "The top leaders have much bigger houses, closer to the guild headquarters, but most members live in places like this."</p>

<p>"Looks like being a member comes with some amazing perks indeed!" said Kiara, as she took in the surroundings.</p>

<p>"The dangers balance it out" Elena let out a short laugh, but Kieran noticed the way her fingers tightened against the mattress she was holding. "Anyway, I have pulled out these spare beds for you guys. If you need anything, just call me, I shall be in my room."</p>

<p>Kiara gave Elena a small nod. "Thanks, Elena. You should get some rest too."</p>

<p>"Goodnight then, Elena" said Kieran, heading for the bed. He was exhausted from all the walking, but he was curious to know about what really was this organization, and what Elena meant by dangers. He would be finding out soon enough.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Morning sunlight streamed into the room, waking up Kieran from his sleep. Kiara was still sleeping. She always used to wake up pretty late, and it was Kieran's everyday routine dragging her out of bed for their work.</p>

<p>"Up already huh? We need to get going then" said Elena, who was sitting on the couch, reading something.</p>

<p>"Kiara is not going to wake up anytime soon," said Kieran, heading over to Kiara and giving her a shake. "Wake up, we have stuff to do"</p>

<p>Kiara jumped out of her bed, and without a pause, folded her mattress to put it away, leaving Kieran in stunned silence.</p>

<p>"That's a record breaking wake up time right there Kia," said Kieran, putting away his own mattress too.</p>

<p>"Yeah, we have a busy day ahead of us, you know."</p>

<p>With a resigned shake of his head, Kieran got ready to leave. Once they had finished with the pack of instant noodles provided by Elena, they started heading out towards the headquarters. There were many people out and about, and quite a few of them cast curious glances at Kieran and his sister.</p>

<p>"I am pretty sure news about you guys would have reached the headquarters," said Elena. "Just explain yourselves calmly and you should be fine"</p>

<p>The main building of the headquarters loomed before Kieran, tall and imposing. It was of a similar design to the city square, just a lot bigger. Elena went ahead of him, and cracked open the door, revealing the insides of the hall. It was ornately decorated, with huge pillars and designs everywhere. At the end of the hall, there were four figures standing, glaring at Elena with a sharp look. It looked like they were not happy to see Kieran and his sister there at all.</p>

<p>"Elena, may I know what the Solvaris siblings are doing here" said a figure in the middle, his voice laced with anger. He was wearing a robe the shade of the setting sun.</p>

<p>"I am truly sorry Captain Tianxi." Said Elena, carefully staring at the floor. "They ended up catching me practicing my fighting out in the fields"</p>

<p>"All you had to do is ignore them, and move on" Tianxi sighed, turning his gaze to Kieran and Kiara. "Please forget about us. If we let you guys in, your parents will make sure to shut this organization down."</p>

<p>"Our parents? They are not anywhere near the city," said Kiara. "They said they had something important to do, and went away about half a year back. There is no way they will even bother shutting you down, just because we are here."</p>

<p>Tianxi's face was a portrait of surprise. "Wait, that does not sound like them, are you guys in contact at least?"</p>

<p>"They message once in a while" replied Kieran. "Enough about that, are you guys letting us in or not?"</p>

<p>"Not formally, that will get all the other organizations after us" said Tianxi. "We do have a better idea, since Elena was the one who brought you guys here, she will be assigned to train you as punishment. Make sure to keep them safe Elena."</p>

<p>Elena took a deep bow. "I shall make sure to protect them till they can use their Nightshroud powers properly, Captain Tianxi."</p>

<p>Captain Tianxi headed towards Kieran, and handed him a spherical object. It looked like a cloud was swirling inside it, giving off a faint blue glow. He handed a similar glowing sphere to Kiara too.</p>

<p>"Elena will teach you how to use it" said Tianxi. "You may use an empty apartment as your base. We will assign one close to Elena's. You are dismissed"</p>

<p>"One last question" interjected Kieran. "Who were my parents even?"</p>

<p>Tianxi and the other leaders just gave Kieran a soft look before turning away. "Nope, we have no idea who they are. Please be on your way now."</p>

<p>Giving them a quick bow, Kieran slowly started making his way for the exit. It was clear they were hiding something, but he had no idea how to get the truth from them.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER 3</p>

<p>Kieran was seated at a restaurant table, across Elena and Kiara. They had headed straight to a restaurant that Elena recommended, so he was treating them to lunch. His Nightshroud crystal was still tightly held in his hands. Kieran brought it closer, watching the clouds of blue swirl and flow within it.</p>

<p>"So, this will unlock our powers huh?"</p>

<p>"A part of it, yeah," said Elena. "A blue crystal is used just for basic protection. If you want to see true power, you will have to find yourself a purple or red one."</p>

<p>"And they did not have any red crystals at the headquarter to give us?" said Kiara, her face an expression of disbelief.</p>

<p>"Nope" replied Elena, her face darkening "The last time we tried to get a red one went very badly. We just don't have enough people here to handle multiple Nightshroud of that level."</p>

<p>Kieran quickly changed the topic on catching her expression. He then started asking her about the other members who were a part of the Eclipse Seekers.</p>

<p>"Our organization is barely holding on compared to the ones in other cities," said Elena. "I'm the only blue crystal user in our age group, the vast majority of them are just green crystals."</p>

<p>"Why don't the leaders just give out a blue crystal to everyone like they did to us?" said Kieran. Something did not seem right about just being given a blue crystal that easily.</p>

<p>"I think, for most people, anything higher than a green crystal just gets rejected by their bodies instantly," said Elena. "I was given a green crystal at first, but upgraded to a blue crystal that I found during that raid I mentioned earlier."</p>

<p>"So, what about us? We have a blue crystal," said Kiara. "You think it will get rejected?"</p>

<p>"The leaders think that you guys should be fine starting off with a blue crystal," said Elena. "They know what they are doing I suppose. Anyway, we shall see how well you integrate once we get the process started."</p>

<p>Once they were done with their food, Elena took them straight to an arena, which Kieran recalled seeing on his way to the headquarters. There were already a few people in there, most of them looked a bit older than him.</p>

<p>A guy with soft black hair and brown eyes glanced over as they approached. Behind him stood a brown-haired guy and a silver-haired girl with striking green eyes.</p>

<p>"Hey Elena, who are those people with you" The black-haired guy asked. "The girl is such a cutie; can I date her?"</p>

<p>Kiara let out a quiet laugh, clearly entertained, but Kieran wasn't as amused. "Please do not flirt with my sister."</p>

<p>Before the guy could respond, the brown-haired guy sighed and reached over, giving his ear a sharp tug. "Ignore Jin. He flirts with everything that moves,"</p>

<p>Shaking her head, Elena replied. "It's Kieran and Kiara, I think should explain everything." Turning to Kieran and Kiara, she gestured towards the trio. "These are Jin, Cillian, and Isla. They have been members for a long time now."</p>

<p>Isla whistled. "No wonder the leaders were cranky today when we met them. You managed to recruit them huh?"</p>

<p>"Well, not formally," said Elena. "We are supposed to keep them associated with the Eclipse Seekers, so they assigned a new member like me to train them."</p>

<p>Kieran decided to try his luck getting information out of these members. They all were talking about him and Kiara as if they were some important people, but the leaders did not answer at all.</p>

<p>Kieran turned his gaze towards Isla. "I asked the leaders this, and got no reply. Who are my parents anyway?"</p>

<p>"See, from what I heard, they were bigshots around these parts," said Isla. "Don't know anything more than that though."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that was obvious enough, seeing the way we are being treated," said Kiara. "So even you guys don't know anything else huh?"</p>

<p>"I shall ask the leaders for more information if you want," said Isla. "I shall update you if I learn anything new"</p>

<p>Giving her a quick nod, Kiara turned towards Elena. "Now please show us how to integrate with this crystal here."</p>

<p>"It's a simple process," said Elena. "Hold out the crystal close to you, and try visualizing your strength flowing into it."</p>

<p>Kieran held the crystal close to him, trying to follow Elena's instructions. He did not know what visualizing strength was meant to be, but he just meditated and focused on his wish of always wanting something similar to this. After nearly a minute, the weight on his hands suddenly vanished, leaving behind no trace of the crystal. His sister did not have the crystal either. He could hear the sounds of clapping from the others who were present in the arena.</p>

<p>"With that, you are successfully integrated with the crystal," said Elena. "Now if you wait for a bit, a creature should pop into existence, which will protect you" </p>

<p>With a bright flash of light, two creatures materialized in front of Kieran. The one closest to him looked like a small dragon, but it did not have wings. The other creature resembled a small armoured snake. That one probably belonged to Kiara, as it slithered to her, checking her out.</p>

<p>Kiara did not show any hesitation in straight up hugging the snake. "A magic snake for a pet? It's my lucky day!"</p>

<p>Kieran's own Nightshroud was staring curiously at him, as if waiting for something. he stepped closer, reaching out his hand toward his Nightshroud. It hesitated for a moment before taking slow, steady steps forward. Finally, it allowed him to touch it. Its skin felt strong yet flexible, cool beneath his fingertips. Suddenly, a flash interrupted his vision. It looked like Elena decided to bring out her Nightshroud as well.</p>

<p>Elena's Nightshroud was a bearlike creature, which Kieran recalled catching a glimpse of earlier. It took a defensive stance in front of Elena, eyeing the new Nightshrouds carefully. Elena slowly ran her hands across its fur, petting the creature to calm it down.</p>

<p>"Don't worry Biero, they are our friends," said Elena. "We will be going on missions with them"</p>

<p>Seemingly having calmed down, Biero started playfighting with Kieran's Nightshroud, as well as Kiara's. Meanwhile Kieran knew he needed to settle on a name fast. He went through a few names before settling on Atsuki, as he liked how it sounded.</p>

<p>"Kia, did you name your Nightshroud yet?</p>

<p>Kiara who was staring at her Nightshroud, turned to Kieran. "Obviously, it is named Viperion."</p>

<p>"It's a name so generic, that only you could have come up with" said Kieran, dodging his sister's look of outrage. Viperion sounded like a name of a ship or something to him, though he kept that thought to himself.</p>

<p>"I will take the name Viperion any day over Atsuki" she replied, heading over to Viperion. Elena, who was talking to Isla and the others, waved Kieran over.</p>

<p>"We shall set out for a mission in a few days. That shall be a good opportunity for you guys to train your Nightshrouds"</p>

<p>"Alright then" said Kieran, watching as the Nightshrouds finished playing, and headed towards them. It was nearly the end of the day, and they had to go back. After saying his goodbyes to Jin and the others, Kieran, Kiara, and Elena headed back to the house they were staying in. </p>

<p>To his surprise, Kieran saw a house in that same street, fully prepared and open. There were a few workers standing there.</p>

<p>"We were instructed to ready this house for Kieran and Kiara," said a worker. "This will be where you two will be staying from now on"</p>

<p>On entering the house, Kieran could see it was an exact copy of Elena's house, but there were two rooms instead of one. Kiara headed to the bigger room, which was located in the corner of the house and claimed it.</p>

<p>"This shall be my room," said Kiara. "You can have the smaller one there."</p>

<p>Whatever, Kieran did not necessarily want a bigger room, so he was fine with it. He planned to be out and about most of the time anyway. Sighing, he headed to his room, and saw it was already prepared with blankets and everything else.</p>

<p>"Wow" said Elena, who was sitting in a couch, watching the others explore the house. "You guys sure do get VIP treatment huh? The quality of the items here seems top notch. I am claiming this as place as my main hangout spot"</p>

<p>Laughing, Kieran returned from his room, and plopped down on the couch next to Elena. "Feel free to stay here whenever you want miss Elena"</p>

<p>"I intend to make full use of this opportunity" said Elena, playfully swatting at Kieran. "Anyway, I need to get going, we shall meet again tomorrow morning"</p>

<p>Elena got up and waved, heading for the exit.</p>

<p>"Goodnight, Elena!" said Kiara, watching as her figure disappeared into the night.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER 4</p>

<p>The next few days went by in a flash. It mostly involved Elena showing Kieran and Kiara around the headquarters. Occasionally, they ran into Isla and her friends, but they seemed very busy, barely even present in the headquarters. The leaders were also were missing from the headquarters, with some others standing in for them, people who Kieran did not see earlier.</p>

<p>Kieran used the time to practice with Atsuki, just like Elena did. They were not allowed to fight each other, but solo practice seemed just as helpful. Finally, the day of the mission arrived. They were hanging out at Kieran's place, discussing the plan of action.</p>

<p>"Depending on how well this mission goes, you will get to keep any purple crystals you claim from there," said Elena. "The leaders do have purple crystals at the headquarters, but it is only given after a year of being a member due to how rare it is."</p>

<p>"Do you think we will be able to take out Nightshrouds of purple level," said Kieran. He kept his voice even, but he could not shake off feeling that they would be wiped out instantly the second they were attacked. The Nightshrouds were dangerous creatures after all.</p>

<p>Elena responded quickly. Far too quickly in fact, but Kieran caught the slight tremor in her voice. "Well, the place we are going to is already scouted out by Isla and her group. There is just a single purple crystal Nightshroud there. The three of us should be more than enough to take it out."</p>

<p>Before Kieran could say anything, Kiara started heading towards the door. "Perfect then, let's get the purple crystal's power for ourselves," </p>

<p>Elena caught her by the arm. "Hold on, we need to get the weapons from the headquarters before we leave."</p>

<p>Kiara nodded, and they started walking towards the headquarters main building. As they walked through the empty halls, Kieran's unease deepened. The air around him was too quiet, all sounds swallowed up by the vast emptiness.</p>

<p>The leaders were not present here, again. </p>

<p>The halls slowly darkened, leading to a corridor of some sort. It stretched before him, dim and uncertain.</p>

<p>"What is this place even?" asked Kieran, taking in the passageway around him.</p>

<p>"Our armoury is up ahead," said Elena. "It was designed this way as a security measure. I should be able to find some spare ANGs over there"</p>

<p>"ANG? Kiara tilted her head. "What's that" </p>

<p>"It's short for Anti Nightshroud Guns," Elena explained "It's very easy to use, so no training is required."</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor, Kieran could see a huge metal door standing in their way. Elena headed to it and pushed it. With a few creaks of protest, the door swung open revealing a room full of guns. Kieran reached for the nearest one, running his fingers across the steampunk inspired design. It felt well balanced in his hands.</p>

<p>"This almost feels like a game" said Kiara, spinning her gun, before pointing it at random objects.</p>

<p>Elena gave Kiara a sharp glare. "If you fire it by mistake, it will blow up this entire building"</p>

<p>Kiara hastily lowered her gun, giving a sheepish smile "Almost forgot this is a real weapon, my bad"</p>

<p>Shaking her head, Elena grabbed a weapon of her own from the wall, and turned towards Kieran, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.</p>

<p>"Come, lets pull off a successful mission for once"</p>

<p>Leaving the armoury, they headed outside. After a bit of a walk, they reached the edge of the headquarter barrier. From the inside, it looked like a translucent wall, shimmering and swirling ahead of Kieran. Kiara gave it a cautious look, keeping her distance from it.</p>

<p>"Go on, the barrier will allow you guys to leave and enter now" said Elena, vanishing out of sight after crossing the barrier. Kieran soon followed, along with Kiara, and they were out of the Eclipse Seeker Headquarters. Kieran could see no sign of entire area even existing.</p>

<p>"Well then, the city barrier is about ten minutes from here, and the raid location is twenty minutes away from there," said Elena in a business-like tone, checking the route on her phone.</p>

<p>"Hold on, let me send you the route." Elena looked through her phone before pausing. "I never did get your contact detail did I, Kieran? I have your sister's as she gave me hers a few days back"</p>

<p>Kieran took his phone out, navigating to the connections page, and held it out to Elena. "Here you go."</p>

<p>Elena quickly added his details to the chat app, and send him the route. Kieran opened to find the route neatly marked on his map. As he glanced at the chat icons, his stomach dropped. His profile picture. </p>

<p>And Elena was now looking right at it.</p>

<p>"Nice profile picture, Kieran" Elena remarked, her voice laced with amusement. "Very creative of you indeed"</p>

<p>"Yes, his profile picture is very unique indeed" added Kiara, barely supressing her laugher. "I think he forgot that even existed"</p>

<p>Yup, Kieran totally forgot about that. He should have changed it ages ago, but wasn't bothered enough. Most of his friends had worse profile pictures than this, so he didn't have much of a reason to change it.</p>

<p>The picture right there next to his name, in full display was an old, ridiculous photo of himself, which was edited to look like a warrior, fighting some monsters.</p>

<p>He recalled even Kiara's was something just as stupid, but it seemed like she had changed it recently. What a traitor.</p>

<p>Kieran glanced at the screen with a faint laugh. "That's an old photo from back when I was testing out my editing skills" he said. "I shall swap it out now."</p>

<p>Taking out his phone, Kieran tapped the menu panel to change the image. He selected some random flower pictures and set that. Too late, but at least the picture was not visible anymore.</p>

<p>"Ah, he changed it," said Elena. "Very unfortunate indeed"</p>

<p>"No worries" replied Kiara. "I shall send you the photo if you want."</p>

<p>"Please do," said Elena, barely holding back her laugher. </p>

<p>Kieran sighed. All he could do now was to wait till they forgot about it. Anyway, he had bigger things to worry about. They had reached the city barrier, and they were finally exiting the city for once.</p>

<p>Elena stopped right in front of the barrier. "Now then, we just have a bit more to go. Keep your weapons ready"</p>

<p>Kieran was greeted with the same dull view he saw ages ago. The sky burned through the red desert in front of him. Kieran could feel himself sweating, it was boiling hot. Beside him, Kiara was staring at the landscape outside in wonder. This was Kiara's first time seeing it. This was all new to her, but Kieran had already seen it before.</p>

<p>"There is a whole desert outside out city," said Kiara. "I am surprised our city is even surviving in this heat. The barrier is doing an amazing job indeed."</p>

<p>"That is the reason I told you guys to wear something lighter," said Elena. She was wearing comfortable clothing, which seemed airy enough. Kieran had to admit it did look good on her, reminding him of the moonlit girl he saw at the clearing.</p>

<p>Elena glanced at Kieran, giving him a questioning look. "Something's the matter?"</p>

<p>Kieran shook his head. "Nope, I just got reminded of the day when we met you, a strange figure dancing through the moonlight."</p>

<p>Elena gave a small smile. "Very poetic indeed, but I was just practicing my movement and battle skills. I wanted to get as strong as possible you know?"</p>

<p>Kieran understood that sentiment. Afterall, he had the same goal too.</p>

<p>Elena cast a warm gaze at Kieran and his sister. "Now that I met you guys, I finally have a real chance of getting a purple crystal."</p>

<p>"That is exactly we will do" said Kieran firmly. "We can even get a red crystal one day, and be strong enough to even change the world."</p>

<p>Kiara smacked Kieran with a laugh. "Changing the world? That's a tall order indeed." She turned towards Elena with a wink. "But yeah, we will make sure you clear raids easily."</p>

<p>Elena's expression softened. "Thanks, guys. I didn't even have to explain myself, and you're already supporting me" </p>

<p>Kieran offered a small smiled. "You can always rely on us, no problem!" he said, as they slowly made their way towards the marked location.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER 5</p>

<p>The location that was marked on Elena's map led to a cave-like structure, which was currently looming in front of her, like the maw of an ancient beast. There was no Nightshrouds to be found around, not even the purple one which they were meant to fight. This meant that they had to go further inside the cave systems, or bait them out of the caves.</p>

<p>"Are we supposed to go inside the caves or something?" said Kieran, with a tone that suggested he found the idea interesting. </p>

<p>Elena swatted at Kieran. "That's like going from a frying pan into the fire, you know?"</p>

<p>"Any other ideas then?" asked Kiara.</p>

<p>Elena already knew the best plan of action "Get your Nightshrouds out, and we can bait the creatures outside" Elena summoned her Nightshroud, bringing out Biero with a flash. Biero was soon joined by Atsuki and Viperion, their sleek forms standing like a wall at their sides.</p>

<p>"That will get them rushing here instantly," said Elena. As if right on cue, sounds of rumbling footsteps could be heard emanating from the caves. Hordes of small creatures started pouring out from the caves. </p>

<p>Elena cocked her gun, taking aim. "Our Nightshrouds will take care of the fighting for the most part, we just need to keep firing."</p>

<p>With a deafening bang, her gun fired, wiping out all the creatures caught in the blast. The stench of burning flesh filled her lungs, bringing up some memories she kept buried, but she quickly pushed it out of her mind. After all, this wasn't the past, and she was not alone now. </p>

<p>Elena glanced over at Kiara, who was finishing off the creatures that managed to make it past their defence. She carefully guided her Nightshroud to demolish the wild nightshrouds, reducing their numbers one by one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kieran had gone to the frontlines with his Nightshroud, and was picking off the creatures right as they came outside. Elena could see he had gained a lot more confidence seeing the wild nightshrouds get blasted apart easily.</p>

<p>These were just green level nightshrouds though. Elena knew real trouble would start once the blue ones arrive. Even if they could not do any magic, they were really hardy. Then there was the object of their mission, the purple Nightshroud, which was capable of doing some nasty elemental magic. Elena sighed. She just hoped the three of them were enough to take it on.</p>

<p>Slowly, the flow of the green nightshrouds started dying down. Elena could see the dead bodies of the nightshrouds scattered all around. The cave was silent, providing a short relief from the constant battle.</p>

<p>Elena took a deep breath before calling out "Kieran, Kiara, regroup!"</p>

<p>"The blue nightshrouds will be here soon," Elena continued, scanning the dead creatures lying in front of her. "Behind them will be the purple Nightshroud. Just be careful, as they can blow us up with pure magical energy"</p>

<p>Kieran approached Elena, his Nightshroud following him gracefully. "We shall bring them down for sure." He said, his voice steady.</p>

<p>Elena, Kieran, and Kiara stood ready, their weapons pointed right at the cave. Their nightshrouds were standing right in front of them, waiting for an attack. The cave rumbled again, announcing the arrival of something far larger than before.</p>

<p>With a loud roar, nightshrouds the size of Elena's own Nightshroud started pouring out of the cave. Elena took aim and fired, her shot hitting the Nightshroud point blank. It froze, stunned by the impact and fell over unmoving.</p>

<p>"That did not even kill it?" said Kiara, her grip tightening on her gun "How are we supposed to kill them anyway?"</p>

<p>"As long as we stun them, our Nightshrouds will take care of the rest," said Elena. She looked at Biero, and pointed to the fallen creature, giving Biero a silent command.</p>

<p>Instantly, Biero started heading towards the wild Nightshroud, the other Nightshrouds following it. With a vicious slash, they tore into the creature, ripping it apart in seconds.</p>

<p>"There we go," said Elena. "Take out as many nightshrouds as you can, before the purple creature arrives."</p>

<p>Elena focused her gun on the rapidly moving targets, taking them down one by one. Each time a wild Nightshroud fell, her Nightshroud finished it off with brutal efficiency. </p>

<p>To her left, Kieran fired his gun with sharp precision, blasting through the creatures. His Nightshroud was having a bit of trouble matching his moments, but that was to be expected for an inexperienced Nightshroud. Kiara fought nearby, Viperion protecting her from any nightshrouds by dispatching them instantly.</p>

<p>Just when Elena thought they were done with the blue nightshrouds, A loud roar shook the earth. A large figure emerged, crawling out of the cave. Elena could see its pincers clicking ominously, as its eyes rapidly scanned the environment.</p>

<p>Kieran and Kiara, who were near her, had stopped fighting, and were staring at the giant ant, their faces wearing an expression of surprise. Right, this was their first time seeing a full-size purple Nightshroud unlike her. Elena had seen even bigger creatures, which were the red nightshrouds.</p>

<p>Kieran turned to Elena with a questioning look. "How do you think we are supposed to defeat this?"</p>

<p>"Make sure to avoid the attacks of the Ant" said Elena, pointing her gun on the creature. "If we keep firing continuously, it should tire out eventually"</p>

<p>The constant barrage of the firing weapons caught the attention of the antlike creature. It focused its attention on them, letting out a huge roar. Elena shivered. She never expected a sound like that to come from an ant. </p>

<p>Without warning, jagged spikes of ice started heading towards them at full speed. Elena barely had the time to react, Biero and the other Nightshrouds jumped in front of them, shattering the ice shards with a powerful strike. Splinters of ice lay scattered around them, releasing a cold mist.</p>

<p>Kiara whistled. "So that's the power of a purple Nightshroud crystal huh?" Her eyes gleamed, unfazed by the danger.</p>

<p>Elena exhaled slowly. "If you don't keep moving, this will be the last time you get to see it" she threw Kiara a quick smile.</p>

<p>Magic had never been kind to Elena, but she supposed that there was something fascinating about watching it for the first time.</p>

<p>"Yeah, my sister has no sense of danger at all," said Kieran, shaking his head at Kiara. He looked much more shaken up over the close call. Elena could see his gun shaking slightly.</p>

<p>"Anyway, watch out for the next set of attacks," said Elena. "It will start firing the ice shards again soon"</p>

<p>With that, Elena waited for the next attack. The ant's gaze was narrowed at them, hate clearly visible through its glare. It roared again, sending another round of ice missiles at them. Elena was prepared this time, sending gunfire right at the ant's face. The creature staggered, losing control of the ice missiles. Their Nightshrouds easily took care of the few shards which did come close.</p>

<p>Beside her, Elena could see Kieran and Kiara doing the same thing. They fired shots directly at the ant's face, staggering it enough to make it lose its aim. It tried firing a few more shards, but barely any of it came near them. It looked like they were winning at last, but Elena was sure it had a few more tricks up its sleeve.</p>

<p>"It is preparing for a heavier attack," Elena shouted out a warning. "Be careful everyone"</p>

<p>Just as she suspected, the ant now started roaring, screaming something in a guttural voice. Elena cursed her luck. This creature was probably closer to a red Nightshroud being than a purple Nightshroud being, seeing that it could do an area wide spell.</p>

<p>The sky turned grey, dark clouds gathering in the sky. They all kept firing at the ant, to kill it before it could finish its spell. Abruptly, the creature stopped as if exhausted. It glanced at them with a strange expression and fell over. The sky instantly cleared, returning to the orange sunset which was there earlier.</p>

<p>It looked like they had won. Elena had no clue how to stop a red level spell, and she was thankful that it died before the spell could be completed.</p>

<p>Kieran who was staring at the sky, turned to Elena. "Do you have any idea what that was about?"</p>

<p>Elena sighed. "All I can say is, we got lucky. That Nightshroud was an upper purple level. A red Nightshroud can easily use area wide spells like this in an instant."</p>

<p>"Now, how are we supposed to extract the Nightshroud crystal?" said Kiara, staring at the corpse of the giant ant. She headed a bit closer to the ant, looking at it with a curious expression.</p>

<p>"Just wait a bit and look what happens," said Elena. This was the best part of a raid, and according to her, it was something that one should experience with their own eyes. </p>

<p>As Elena watched the fallen antlike creature, it started glowing brightly. A stream of glittery purple substance started rising out of the giant creatures. Similarly, all around them, the bodies of the dead nightshrouds started glowing, and releasing streams of coloured dust which swirled all around them, like millions of fireflies. It headed high up into the sky, condensing into a sphere, which then slowly floated down. </p>

<p>Elena quickly headed towards the purple Nightshroud sphere, and caught it gently in her hands. She let out a sigh of relief. Finally, something she had been wanting for so long was right in her hands, and all they had to do was to get back safely to the headquarters. She turned to Kieran and Kiara, who was inspecting the other Nightshroud crystals.</p>

<p>"That was beautiful indeed," said Kiara mesmerized by the display. She then turned to Elena with a smirk. "Now you are officially a purple crystal user huh?"</p>

<p>"We all are" Elena corrected, glancing at the both of them. "Since we defeated the creature together, you should be able to integrate with a purple Nightshroud without any problems. The leaders will be willing to spare you two some purple crystals"</p>

<p>Kieran grinned. "Ah perfect, that means we can go on even more raids"</p>

<p>Elena just smiled, shaking her head slowly. Now that she had such a strong team put together, she hoped she could get strong enough to find out the truth of why her city was attacked, all those years back.</p>

<p>Turning, Elena took a few steps forward away from the carnage when suddenly, the sky went completely dark. She glanced at the sky in alarm. Dark clouds now covered the evening sky, blotting out any light from reaching them. Where did a red Nightshroud bring appear from? Elena spun around, checking if something new emerged from the cave, but it was just as silent as before.</p>

<p>Kiara gave Elena a confused glance. "What just happened? I can barely see you"</p>

<p>"It looks like our luck has run out," said Elena, glaring at the sky. "The only thing we can do now is to run, before the red Nightshroud appears."</p>

<p>"Can't we just get on our Nightshrouds, and escape easily?" asked Kieran, already starting to climb Atsuki.</p>

<p>"That is like running with a beacon," said Elena, dismissing Biero with a wave. "It will point our location out to every creature nearby"</p>

<p>Kieran hurriedly dismissed his Nightshroud, and Kiara did the same. Once that was done, Elena and the others started running at full speed towards the city barrier.  Unfortunately, they still had a lot of ground to cover. Glancing behind her, Elena could see Kieran and Kiara struggling to keep up. </p>

<p>Kieran was panting hard, and Kiara was slowing down considerably. It certainly looked like they were not used to running at all. It was fine though. Elena could not see any creatures nearby at all. The sky still remained stubbornly dark, but at least they were safe enough for now.</p>

<p>After a while of this mad dash, Elena could see the city come into view in the distance. It was just a matter of time now, and it looked like they could get away unscathed. She slowed down, letting the others catch their breaths.</p>

<p>"Ow, my everything hurts" said Kiara in between breaths.</p>

<p>Elena smiled, remembering the strict training they put her through. "You will get used to it soon enough after a bit of training" she said. "This is our way of life after all"</p>

<p>Elena turned to Kieran to check up on him. He was staring at something in the distance. Following his gaze, she could see a lone figure approaching them. Alarm bells started ringing in her head, but she could not realise why.</p>

<p>"Is that someone coming to help us or what?" asked Kiara. "That definitely does not look like a Nightshroud."</p>

<p>When the figure approached a bit closer, Elena's memory was jogged, sending a chill down her spine. The figure had a very familiar inscription on its armour.</p>

<p>Elena paled. "Call your Nightshrouds out. We might be in bigger trouble than I thought."</p>

<p>With a flash, Atsuki and Viperion joined Biero, who was standing in front of Elena, taking a defensive pose. </p>

<p>"Hello young lady, Interesting collection of people you got there"</p>

<p>Elena held her gun aimed steady at the figure's face. "What business do you have with us?"</p>

<p>The strange person let out a cruel smiled, their silver blue hair shaking in the wind. "Calm down a little, would you? I am not here for you either way." The person pointed to Kiaran and his sister. "Those two are the reason I am here"</p>

<p>On hearing that, Elena pulled the trigger instantly, sending a round of gunfire directly into the person. Just as she feared though, as the smoke cleared, the person there was still standing there, completely unharmed. With a flicker, the person vanished, appearing near Kieran in an instant.</p>

<p>The person's speed was so high, that Elena found it hard to track them. It was clear they had no chance of walking away if this person decided to fight. All she could do was to buy time till someone from the city noticed.</p>

<p>"How very rude of you, I must say people these days have no manners at all," said the person. They stalked towards Kieran, placing a hand on him.</p>

<p>Kieran swatted away the hand, eyes fixed on the person. "Who are you? Are you a gold crystal user?"</p>

<p>"Gold crystal user? Oh, you mean those thieves? No boy, we are the Nightshroud Generals. And today, we come to collect payment for the sins of your parents"</p>

<p>Elena had no idea that there were even sentient nightshrouds. This just raised more questions. Why did they even come for her city? She had no clue.</p>

<p>Kieran did not flinch. "So, you just a Nightshroud after all, just one that can talk."</p>

<p>"Kieran, careful" said Elena, with a note of warning in her voice. </p>

<p>"If their target was to kill us, they would have killed us long back," said Kiara. "I think Kiaran is counting on that fact"</p>

<p>Kiara was right, but knowing how unpredictable nightshrouds were in general, even Elena would not dare mess with them, even if they were sentient.</p>

<p>"What did I say about respect again?" said the Nightshroud. It raised a hand towards Kieran and Kiara, as if to grab them, but suddenly changed its mind. Elena could hear sounds of footsteps. She turned towards the city to see the leaders had arrived, with their nightshrouds ready to attack.</p>

<p>"Consider yourselves lucky kids, I don't have the patience to fight right now. We will meet again!" With a sharp look, the Nightshroud leapt up, speeding up and vanishing from view.</p>

<p>Elena sighed in relief. Crisis averted. All that was left to do now was to grab the leaders and question them.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER 6</p>

<p align="center">Academy Arc</p>

<p>Kieran and the others slowly walked back towards the base, after defeating the giant ant. Its crystal was still tightly clutched by Elena, who was walking beside him. The whole raid was really a close call, and the fact that they could have died easily did not escape Kieran. For all his dreams about going out and fighting Nightshrouds, he did not expect to feel this powerless.</p>

<p>Then there was the strange Nightshroud which could talk. Kieran had been terrified, but he did all he could to keep it focused on him, to make sure the others were protected. Kieran sighed, letting out a slow breath. Somehow the Nightshroud General left them unharmed, raising more questions.</p>

<p>On reaching the Headquarters, Kieran and the others immediately headed towards the main building to give a status report on their raid. He knew this was the perfect chance to guilt trip the leaders into revealing more. Surely, they knew something at least. And if they didn't? it would be such a shame indeed.</p>

<p>Luckily for Kieran, one of the leaders were present in the office. She looked at them with a questioning look. Kieran looked around for Captain Tianxi, but he was nowhere to be found. Beside him, Elena quickly ran to the leader, and started giving a quick report of what happened. </p>

<p>"That is all Captain Rin," said Elena. "Now for the elephant in the room, what are even those Nightshrouds that look like humans?"</p>

<p>Captain Rin sighed, shaking her head. "I did not expect your team to run into them, though I should have seen it coming. We even made sure that those pesky Nightshroud generals were nowhere near this area" She continued "It's a long story, so please take a seat"</p>

<p>It was annoying indeed that it took such an event to get more information, but Kieran was finally close to the truth at last.</p>

<p>"Do they have something to do with my parents?" questioned Kieran, taking a seat at the seats near the desk along with Kiara. Elena remained standing for some reason, her face holding an expression Kieran had never seen her make before.</p>

<p>"It has everything to do with your parents actually," said Captain Rin. "Back when we were all part of the same team, we eventually faced off against one of the Nightshrouds generals, who your father took down. The other generals want revenge I suppose."</p>

<p>No wonder the Nightshroud wanted to kidnap Kieran and his sister. He did wonder though, why didn't they kill him on sight? Did they want to use him as leverage or something?</p>

<p>"Good job telling us this crucial information very early indeed" said Elena, her voice dripping with sarcasm. </p>

<p>"Not our problem, as you were the one who dragged Kieran and Kiara into this mess," said Captain Rin, with an unapologetic look. "I did say it would be dangerous after all"</p>

<p>Elena gave a glare but said nothing, plopping down on the seat nearby. As if to diffuse the situation, Kiara started questioning Captain Rin.</p>

<p>"Any other information you are not telling us?" said Kiara, giving the captain a pointed look.</p>

<p>"That is all we know," said Captain Rin. "In fact, we did not even consider this as important information, as we made sure you guys won't run into the Nightshroud generals. I have no idea how that creature broke through all our defences. That is the reason we were there at the right moment"</p>

<p>Kieran glanced at Elena, who seemed to have cooled down a bit after hearing this. He understood the feeling. Elena was probably worried that she got them involved in something big. Though, he was the one who had decided to learn more about Nightshrouds, and was well aware of the dangers that came with it.</p>

<p>"So where can we even find out more about these Nightshrouds anyway?" said Kieran, with a hint of disappointment. They really did not know anything more. Maybe his parents knew something? He made a mental note to shoot them a message, though he had a feeling they would probably get pretty angry.</p>

<p>"You could try asking the older divisions of the Eclipse Seekers," said Captain Rin. "Divisions one and two consists of people from the Shadow Line, which as you might know, is the military that protects our Capital." She paused, as if waiting for questions.</p>

<p>"What about divisions three and four then?" asked Kiara.</p>

<p>"They are made of people from the Nightshroud Hunter Agency," said the captain. "Our division, as well as division six and seven, comes under our Redhawk government. These three factions are the ones that formed The Eclipse Seekers."</p>

<p>Yeah, it looked easier said than done, but atleast Kieran had a starting point now and a clear target to reach.</p>

<p>The captain continued. "I would recommend going to the Capital, and asking around in division three or four. There is a training academy that belongs to our government there. Just train there for a bit while searching for more information."</p>

<p>"Any information on the first two divisions?" asked Elena, who had been listening intently beside Kieran.</p>

<p>"They are the most mysterious of the bunch, so I would advise caution," said captain Rin. "Most of their members are war fanatics, and you would be hard pressed to find a normal one." </p>

<p>"What happened to keeping them a secret?" said Elena. "Bringing them to the capital will cause a huge fuss for sure."</p>

<p>"At this point, there's not much we can do," Captain Rin replied with a sigh. "Just try to keep a low profile." She got up from her desk, and started putting the books away. "We shall send over purple crystals tomorrow. Get going then, once you reach the Capital, we leaders shall sort the academy stuff out."</p>

<p>It was late evening by the time they were done. Kieran and the others started heading back towards the house.</p>

<p>"We just settled in the here, and now we have to move all over again" complained Kiara, throwing the door of their house open.</p>

<p>"This house came fully furnished, and all our stuff are still back at our house in the city, what are you even complaining about?" said Kieran, shaking his head. Classic Kiara indeed.</p>

<p>"No, it's just that we barely arrived here a week back, and we have to leave already you know?"</p>

<p>"Atleast we will have Elena with us, so it won't be entirely unfamiliar" said Kieran, nodding at Elena, who smiled back.</p>

<p>"You guys will love it over there, it's much grander than you might expect," said Elena, grabbing an apple that was in a basket over the table. "It even rivals the academy building this city has."</p>

<p>"Have you been there, Elena?" Kieran asked.</p>

<p>Elena nodded, staring at the apple in her hand absently.</p>

<p>Kieran blinked. Wait. He'd always figured she was from Ansphin. She knew all the landmarks and even the places only the locals like him knew about. But now, he wasn't so sure.</p>

<p>"I have been there with my parents. My hometown was a teleport station away from the Capital city." She replied, a dark look passing over her face. What Kieran immediately noticed was that Elena referred to her hometown town in past tense.</p>

<p>There was no way. And yet Kieran was sure he arrived at the correct conclusion. He just did not want to voice it and ruin the mood. Glancing at Kiara, it looked like even she had arrived at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Elena sighed. "Its fine, it's already been two years already. My parents are alive, and so are the majority of the population, so we consider ourselves the lucky ones."</p>

<p>A few years back, there was a breach in the barrier of a certain city. It was all over the news at that time. Kieran could vividly remember watching the updates carefully to see if it would survive or not. Unfortunately, the city was entirely razed by the nightshrouds, but evacuation efforts were really successful in saving majority of the population.</p>

<p>"So, you were planning to attend the training academy back then?" asked Kiara, watching Elena place the untouched apple back into the basket.</p>

<p>"Yeah, my parents are Nightshroud hunters like us, or atleast they were till they retired after fighting for our city."</p>

<p>"Damn, your parents are heroes then, our parents probably knew each other then." Said Kiara.</p>

<p>Elena gave a small smile "Yes, heroes indeed." She stood. "Anyway, we need to be up early tomorrow for integration with the crystal"</p>

<p>Kieran turned to his sister. "Did you hear that, Kia? Nice and early. Got it?"</p>

<p>Kiara grabbed the apple and threw it at Kieran, who caught it deftly and returned it to its basket. "I am never late for this kind of stuff you know?"</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER 7</p>

<p>The morning air was cool against Kieran's skin as he and the others made their way to the arena, the same one where they'd first integrated with the blue crystal. It had been just over a week since then. A week filled with rapid changes, and a pace of growth that barely gave him time to catch his breath. And now, here he was, already moving on to the purple crystal.</p>

<p>Standing inside the arena, Kieran took a steadying breath and summoned Atsuki. The familiar weight of the Nightshroud settled beside him, comforting as always. Atsuki looked up at him, letting out soft chirping noises. Kieran held the crystal in his hands, unsure what to do.</p>

<p>"This time, all you have to do is let the crystal touch your Nightshroud," said Elena. "They will gain a random elemental power, and even change their forms a bit"</p>

<p>Kieran decided to go first. He called Atsuki forward till it touched the crystal. With a flash of violet light, Atsuki started reaching upward, till its height nearly matched his own. Curved horns curled from either side of its head, and sleek bluish scales shimmered over its form, glinting faintly in the light. There was something almost regal in the way it stood now. Elena headed towards Kieran to take a look at Atsuki.</p>

<p>"Looks like yours is an ice type Nightshroud," said Elena, gently brushing its scales. "Atsuki will be able to use ranged attacks now, and you will be able to control its moments in battle. Kiara, you go next."</p>

<p>Kiara did the same, touching her crystal with Viperion. The Nightshroud was now much bigger, with an iridescent yellow shine to it.</p>

<p>"That's a lightning type Nightshroud," said Elena, eyeing the glowing streaks across Viperion. "I wonder what mine will be"</p>

<p>Biero's colours shifted. Its fur became more denser, and took on a deep shade of red, with an armour-like shell protecting its head. Kieran noted the way the shade of red seemed to flicker and shift, almost as if it he was in front of a bonfire. It suited Elena perfectly.</p>

<p>"We all have different types, interesting," said Kieran. "I think this makes our overall power go up considerably?"</p>

<p>"The types are complimentary too," said Elena. "My fire type goes well with your ice type, which works perfectly with Kiara's lightning type."</p>

<p>"Didn't you say something about controlling these powers" said Kiara, who was petting Viperion. "How are we supposed to use them?"</p>

<p>"That needs to be learnt in a battle by linking yourself with your Nightshroud," said Elena. Want to duel me? I know how it works as I have seen my parents do it."</p>

<p>Before Kieran could respond, Kiara stepped up beside him and gave him a not-so-gentle push forward. "Kieran can go first," said Kiara, "I don't want to get beat up this early in the morning."</p>

<p>Kieran shook his head. Typical Kiara, dodging effort with a smile and a push. Lazy didn't even begin to cover it.</p>

<p>He turned to Elena, taking a step closer. "Sure," he said, meeting her gaze. "After I learn this, I shall personally beat up Kiara."</p>

<p>Elena let out a laugh, clearly entertained by the interactions between Kieran and his sister. "Alright then, take your position at the ends of the arena!"</p>

<p>Kieran stood at the marked area, with his Nightshroud Atsuki standing in the middle, facing Biero. </p>

<p>"Now then, focus carefully on Atsuki till you can establish a connection with it," said Elena.</p>

<p>Elena reached out to Biero, her hand brushing its fur. She closed her eyes for a while, appearing to focus on the connection. With a sudden flash, Biero went still and focused, while Elena opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"It feels like I am a puppet master" said Elena, slightly unsteady on her feet. "Oh look, I can make Biero move and attack"</p>

<p>Without even any verbal command, Biero started moving around, trying out its fire attacks. Kieran called Atsuki towards him, placing his hands on its scales. He focused carefully, till he felt a strange pull from Atsuki. On reaching towards it, his whole world shifted, making him stagger. It felt like he had just grown extra limbs, a sensory connection to Atsuki. </p>

<p>Kieran tried navigating the area, carefully avoiding Biero's fire attacks. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Kiara standing just outside the arena, her gaze locked on Viperion as she focused, hands slightly raised in concentration.</p>

<p>So now she's serious, huh?</p>

<p>Kieran smiled. Not so lazy anymore. Apparently, fancy elemental attacks were all it took to flip her switch.</p>

<p>Once he was confident enough with his movement, Kieran started checking out the ice team abilities. Kieran was now able to get Atsuki to use a variety of ice-based attacks purely based on the sensory connection. </p>

<p>"Looks like you have got the hang of it fast enough," said Elena, her Nightshroud standing steady for the battle. "The first person to get a hit win, let's go!"</p>

<p>Kieran quickly positioned Atsuki in front of him, waiting for an attack. Elena's Nightshroud was circling Atsuki. Suddenly, Biero starting rapidly shooting out fire projectiles, heading straight for Atsuki. Kieran quickly told Atsuki to dodge it, and responded with his own volley of ice balls. </p>

<p>None of it even hit the mark, as Biero quickly dodged it. Kieran didn't want to wait again. He saw this as a chance to rush Biero before it could unleash another attack, and made Atsuki to rush in for a melee attack. Unfortunately for Kieran, Biero started unleashing a ground-based fire attack, which nearly hit Atsuki.</p>

<p>Kieran retreated, but Biero wasn't done. Under Elena's commands, it quickly followed up with multiple attacks, barely giving Kieran time to breath. He responded instinctively, Atsuki countering with blasts of ice-cool mist clashing against searing heat. For a while, it was enough. But each exchange drained him, his movements growing just a little slower, his focus slipping with every step.</p>

<p>Then it happened.</p>

<p>A stray fireball slipped through the defence and struck Atsuki square in the chest. The explosion cracked through the arena with a dull thud, and Kieran staggered back.</p>

<p>Pain lanced through him a split second later, similar to being slapped by a burning hand. He hissed and dropped to a knee, clutching his side even though he hadn't been touched.</p>

<p>So, this was the link. The shared damage.</p>

<p>Elena recalled Biero, and headed towards Kieran, reaching out her hands.</p>

<p>"That's the link in action," Elena said, her tone soft. "Just take deep breaths. It fades quicker that way. It's sensory pain, not physical. Your body's fine. Atsuki will start healing on its own, too."</p>

<p>Kieran nodded, still catching his breath. He reached out and took Elena's hand, steadying himself. She didn't pull away, just gave him a firm grip, solid and steady, like she'd done this a hundred times before.</p>

<p>And she probably had.</p>

<p>As the pain faded, so did the link, becoming dormant once again.</p>

<p>Kieran glanced at Elena. She had not even flinched during the exchange. No panic, no hesitation. Just clear instructions and quiet confidence.</p>

<p>Yeah. She'd definitely seen this before. And handled it more than a few times.</p>

<p>"That was really a close battle," said Elena. "Amazing, especially since you have never seen a full battle before"</p>

<p>"Thanks Elena," said Kieran. "The way you controlled Biero was just perfect." Elena just smiled softly at Kieran, and turned towards Kiara. "Guess who's turn it is next"</p>

<p>"Sigh, it's going to be very annoying indeed" said Kiara, heading to the Arena. Kieran moved to the stands, watching the ongoing battle. It looked like Elena had run out energy from the battle with him, and Kiara was easily able to finish the battle with a quick lightning strike, leaving Elena in the same situation he was in previously. To her credit though, she seemed to be taking it very well, quickly taking deep breaths to stop the pain. </p>

<p>"I have won!" said Kiara happily, heading towards Elena and helping her up. </p>

<p>"You would have been completely defeated if you would have gone first against her," said Kieran, who had joined them in the arena. </p>

<p>"Oh, fight me then, I shall show you, my strength."</p>

<p>Elena took a few shaky steps, letting out a laugh. "Well fought Kiara, you can fight your brother again when Atsuki recovers."</p>

<p>Kiara tossed her head. "Be ready Kieran! I shall defeat you soon enough!"</p>

<p>Kieran just smiled, turning towards Biero who was standing beside Elena. It was still stunned from the lightning impact. It lowered its head towards Kieran, making a soft purring noise on seeing him.</p>

<p>Without thinking, Kieran reached out and ran his fingers gently through its thick, red fur. The sensation surprised him. It was coarse, but still somehow soft and warm.</p>

<p>A second later, Kiara grabbed his arm, pulling him back. Kieran turned back in confusion until he saw Elena, who had started going red.</p>

<p>Kiara sighed "You idiot, they are still connected,"</p>

<p>Kieran froze, realization crashing into him like a brick wall. The sensory link. Of course. Kieran felt his own face flush.</p>

<p>"Sorry. I didn't mean-" He struggled to find the right words.</p>

<p>"It's fine," Elena said quickly, still avoiding eye contact. Her voice was composed, but her gaze stayed on the ground. "I should have mentioned it earlier. It's not just pain that gets transferred."</p>

<p>Kieran looked away, mortified. Kiara, predictably, looked like she was seconds away from bursting into laughter.</p>

<p>Elena cleared her throat. "Anyway, let's move on. We need to get ready. Redhawk Academy isn't going to wait for us."</p>

<p>As they headed towards their houses, Elena's composure slowly returned, though she still was slightly pink.</p>

<p>Kieran avoided directly looking at her, instead opting to look carefully at his Nightshroud, which was walking beside him. It was easier than looking at Elena, whose reaction from earlier still lingered uncomfortably in his mind.</p>

<p>"You know," Kiara said, walking at his side with way too much satisfaction, "I shall never let you forget this."</p>

<p>Kieran sighed. "Yeah, I figured."</p>

<p>After a short walk, they finally reached their houses. Elena, who was walking slightly ahead, slowed her pace and turned slightly, her expression softening.</p>

<p>"See you tomorrow, then," she said, eyes meeting Kieran's for just a moment. "Don't forget anything important. We have lots of things to do tomorrow."</p>

<p>Her gaze held his for a second longer than it needed to. Then she turned away, her hair catching the light of the setting sun as she walked ahead, leaving behind a trail of thoughts Kieran didn't particularly want to entertain.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER 8</p>

<p>The rising sun streamed in through the windows, waking up Kieran. The timing for the train was still a while away, and he had enough time to eat and get ready. He had to wake up Kiara first though. She would take forever to get ready, if he didn't wake her up early.</p>

<p>Kieran knocked on his sister's door, hoping that was enough to wake her up, and went to take a bath. Surprisingly, by the time he was out of his refreshing bath, Kiara was already up and awake.</p>

<p>"Go check if Elena is done packing, I shall get ready and come in a bit" said Kiara, taking a huge spoonful of cereal.</p>

<p>Kieran nodded, taking a few steps towards the door before freezing. Yesterday's memory of what happened with Elena just hit him. Resolving himself to stay as collected as possible, he headed to Elena's place and knocked on her door. A few moments later, the door swung open to reveal Elena, carrying a bag pack over her shoulder, strands of hair still lose.</p>

<p>"Hey Kieran, up already? I just finished packing," said Elena with an easy smile. She seemed casual enough, though Kieran didn't miss the faint pink that lit up her cheeks on seeing him.</p>

<p>"Yeah, even Kiara is ready," said Kieran, keeping his tone light. "Surprising right?"</p>

<p>"That is unexpected indeed" said Elena, trying to hold her in laugher. "Seems like she is really interested in staying at the academy."</p>

<p>Kiara had finished up everything, and was walking towards Elena and Kieran. "Come on guys, we need to start now, or we will be late"</p>

<p>"You very well know we have plenty of time," said Kieran. </p>

<p>"Yeah, still it's an hour of walking from here," said Kiara. "We can't even use our Nightshrouds in public"</p>

<p>"I have an idea," said Elena. "I don't know if you guys already know about this, but there is an area with some beautiful views on the way to the station."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that sounds perfect," said Kieran. "It's lucky we don't have any luggage apart from our bag packs. Hey Elena, want me to carry your bag? It looks very heavy"</p>

<p>"Thanks for the offer, but I shall manage. I shall let you know if it gets too heavy though," said Elena.</p>

<p>Before Kieran could reply, Kiara pushed her bag into Kieran's arms. "You can carry my bag then" She turned towards Kieran, her tone laced with mischief. "Seems like you're in a real helping mood today, huh?"</p>

<p>"There is barely anything in your bag, very funny Kia" said Kieran, handing the bag back to Kiara, who just smirked.</p>

<p>With a laugh, Elena opened her phone, and sent the location of the hills to Kieran and his sister. With Elena leading the way, they slowly started walking towards the cliff. Kieran had been in the area many times before, but he never bothered exploring the hills surrounding the farmlands. After all, he had always been preoccupied with getting back home as soon as possible, that he never took the time to appreciate the surroundings.</p>

<p>Kieran was well aware that if Kiara hadn't been there with him that day, he never would have explored the flashes, and just headed straight back home. </p>

<p>And Elena, he would have never met her.</p>

<p>That thought struck something in him. Elena was just a friend, someone who he found so easy to talk with. But when she glanced his way with her easy smile, he found himself paying her more attention, the way her hair brushed against her shoulders. All he knew was this wasn't the right time to explore these feelings, so he brushed those thoughts away, and turned towards Elena, who was adjusting her bag.</p>

<p>They were almost near the hills, and it looked like Elena was getting tired. Wordlessly, Kieran held out his hands towards her.</p>

<p>Elena sighed, giving in with a smile, and handing over her bag to Kieran. "Not the one to give up huh? Thanks Kieran."</p>

<p>Kieran could feel Kiara's smug gaze burning into him, but he chose to ignore it. After all he was just helping out a tired friend, nothing more. On walking a bit further, the hills slowly rolled into view. Kieran could see a small path leading up to the top.</p>

<p>Elena headed straight to the path, gesturing for Kieran and Kiara to follow. After a short hike, they finally reached the top.</p>

<p>In front of Kieran, stretched the vast expanse of the golden farmlands with the golden stalks swaying in the breeze. In the distance he could spot the train station surrounded by the forest, and even beyond that was area where the forests died down right before the barrier.</p>

<p>The scene before Kieran was comforting indeed, although the area beyond the barrier was dead and devoid of living life. He just hoped one day, there would be no need for barriers anymore, and everyone could travel the world freely.</p>

<p>Kiara similarly seemed to be entranced by the view, taking out her phone to snap multiple photos of the surroundings.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you this place was beautiful," said Elena.</p>

<p>"You were absolutely right about that" said Kieran, taking in the cool breeze that flew around the hills.</p>

<p>Elena just laughed, turning towards Kieran. "There is still a lot of places I want to show you guys in the academy, so look forward to it!"</p>

<p>Kiara had finished taking her photos, and reached towards Kieran and Elena, pulling them closer. "Time to take a selfie!"</p>

<p>Kieran gazed at the camera as the countdown started. Kiara had done a good job with selecting their position, so that the full background was in view. With a flash, the phone captured their image, engraving it forever.</p>

<p>"I shall send the photos over in the group chat," said Kiara, tapping her phone. Ah right, Kieran remembered that his sister had created a group with the three of them for sharing updates, though it mostly consisted of Kiara and Elena spamming stickers.</p>

<p>"A change of pace to the stickers indeed," agreed Elena. "How about we eat something? I am feeling pretty hungry from all the hiking."</p>

<p>Kieran and the others took out the small jam buns that they had packed earlier, and sat on the huge slabs that was scattered around. After finishing his food, Kieran sat down on the grass nearby, watched as the clouds fly by. He just hoped he could get such peaceful days once in a while even in the academy.</p>

<p>Kiara came over to Kieran, pulling him up. "That's all for today, we have a train to catch."</p>

<p>"Right, I didn't forget, don't worry" said Kieran with a laugh. He put his back pack on, and grabbed Elena's along, as they started down the hill together, with the soft grass crunching beneath their feet. The train station wasn't that far, and there was no need to rush.</p>

<p>After a bit of walking, the station slowly rolled into view. Kieran could not see any trains standing there. Once they leave, there would be no one to manage the supply train, and he had no idea what to do about that.</p>

<p>"Hey Kia, what do we do about the supply train? Once we leave, there won't be anyone to do the work."</p>

<p>"I guess we have to come back here once in a while," said Kiara. "Only during the harvest season that the work is every day."</p>

<p>"Hold on," said Elena. "I am pretty sure the people at our HQ will take care of it, as they knew your parents. I shall let them know right away."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that will fix the problem, thanks" said Kieran, relieved. Together with the others, he watched as the train slowly rolled in, rumbling to a stop. </p>

<p>"Ansphin City Train has arrived" the automatic voice announced, as the doors slid open. Quickly, Kieran stepped in with the others, the familiar hiss of the door closing behind them. The train jolted forward, and for a moment, it felt just the same as the hundreds of time Kieran had ridden this line with Kiara. Only this time, Elena was there too.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The rest of the ride passed by uneventfully. Kieran just listened, as Elena was sharing stories from her life, and stuff she knew about the academy. It even made Kieran interested in learning more about the academy. He wasn't really thrilled about the idea of attending classes again, but from what Elena was describing, the academy seemed grand indeed. </p>

<p>Slowly, the train slid to a stop, opening its doors. Kieran was greeted with the familiar sight of the city's station. This was where multiple trains headed to different parts of the Ansphin farmlands, and it was always filled with activity.</p>

<p>All that was left for Kieran was to head to his house and collect his stuff. Thankfully, his house was a walkable distance from the station. </p>

<p>Kiara got down from the train and headed straight to the stations exit.</p>

<p>"What are we waiting for, let's get going" said Kiara, as she dragged Kieran and Elena towards their house.</p>
