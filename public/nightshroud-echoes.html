    CHAPTER  1

    Introduction  Arc
</p>
<p>
    The evening sunlight cast a warm glow, illuminating the  farmlands
    surrounding the city of Ansphin. The sun was about to set, and Kieran  and
    his younger sister, Kiara, had to get back into the city before the trains
    stopped service. Kieran's family were the ones who managed the food supplies
    for the city, so they had to come out to the farmlands every week and
    oversee  the loading of all the supplies into the train, which delivered it
    directly to Ansphin.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran watched as the workers loaded the last few boxes into  the train. All
    he had to do was to sign the completion form, before he could  finally head
    home. Kieran let his gaze drift around the golden farmlands, watching  the
    cornstalks sway in the breeze. The city had no place like this, only
    endless metal, and stone all around.
</p>
<p>
    The area beyond the farmlands were extremely dangerous for people,  and were
    filled with dangerous creatures walking around. A few years back,  Kieran
    once tried checking what was out there out of pure curiosity, but the
    second he crossed the barrier, a barren wasteland stretched endlessly before
    him. He wandered around for a bit, till a loud roar shattered the silence,
    convincing him to turn back.
</p>
<p>
    There were some people having some strange powers, who could  survive the
    wasteland, but they were very elusive, and rarely appeared in  public.
    Kieran wanted to join them so bad, but he did not possess any powers at  all
    as far as he knew, and neither did his sister.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran sighed, shaking himself from his thoughts. The boxes were  done being
    loaded, and he needed to go and check on his sister. Turning away  from the
    train station, Kieran headed to a small office that was built right  next to
    it. This was where Kiara handled payments. She was just finishing up  when
    he walked in.
</p>
<p>
    "Are all the boxes done being loaded?" asked Kiara, casually  signing some
    documents that was being handed over to her by some farmers.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, it just got over" replied Kieran. "Just get the  payments settled,
    and we can head back home. I am so tired, and I want to catch  up with that
    new show that was supposed to release today."
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, yeah, just a bit more." Said Kiara. "Oh, the show is releasing
    today, right? Almost forgot about that, we shall watch it together when we
    get  back."
</p>
<p>
    Kiara slowly finished up the payments, and Kieran started  walking towards
    the train station. Right when he was about to reach the train  station, a
    sharp flash of light interrupted his vision. It seemed to come from  a bit
    further ahead into the farmlands.
</p>
<p>
    "Did you see that too, Ki?" asked Kieran, turning around.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, I did" said Kiara, who had been walking a bit behind  him, looking up
    something on her phone. "Do you want to go check it out?"
</p>
<p>
    "How do to plan to get back home then?" said Kieran. "The  train will be
    leaving soon, and it's a long walk to the city from this far out."
</p>
<p>
    "It's fine, we can just stay at an inn here till the morning  train." said
    Kiara. "Just inform the workers, and we shall go check it out."
</p>
<p>
    After Kieran was done with the final checks, he and his  sister watched as
    the train slowly departed the station, loaded to the brim  with food. The
    train slowly grew smaller and smaller as it disappeared beyond  the horizon.
    The sky had completely turned dark, and the landscape before him  was lit
    only by the silver glimmer of moonlight.
</p>
<p>
    One good thing about the darkness was that it made it easy to  spot light
    flashes. Kieran barely had to wait before there was another flash of  light
    coming from the general direction of the previous flash.
</p>
<p>
    Kiara, who was scanning the environment intently, quickly  started running
    towards the flash of light "Hurry up, we need to catch up  before they
    leave"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran started running after his sister. He wasn't sure if  the flashes were
    anything that important, but he did want to check it out in  case it was
    something interesting. There was a semi forested area, and it  looked like
    they had to cross it to get there.
</p>
<p>
    "Imagine it is just some random farmer and his torchlight"  said Kieran,
    taking out his phone to check the map. "It looks like we are  nearly at the
    barrier"
</p>
<p>
    "Come on, where is your sense of adventure" Kiara nudged Kieran  with her
    elbow. "There is no way a farmer's torch can make flashes like that"
</p>
<p>
    "We shall see for ourselves soon enough I guess"
</p>
<p>
    As they kept running, the trees slowly started thinning.  Ahead of him,
    Kieran could see a small clearing come into view.
</p>
<p>
    "We need to walk carefully from now on" said Kieran, slowing  his pace to
    reduce the noise that he made. "We don't want to alert whoever or  whatever
    is there"
</p>
<p>
    Kiara nodded, carefully looking around her. "Are we still  within the
    barrier, or did we cross it?"
</p>
<p>
    "We are still inside the barrier," said Kieran. "The barrier  is just past
    that clearing according to this map."
</p>
<p>
    Carefully making sure to stay hidden under the shadows cast  by the trees,
    Kieran and his sister slipped through the trees, their footsteps  muffled by
    the undergrowth. The clearing ahead was bathed in glowing moonlight,
    straight out of a fairytale.
</p>
<p>
    Right in the middle of the clearing was a lone figure, barely  visible, even
    with the moonlight. They definitely were not a farmer, as far as  Kieran
    could tell. The figure did not move, as if waiting for something to  happen.
    A few seconds later, a giant creature blinked into existence, heading
    straight for the lone figure.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran froze, turning sharply to Kiara. "That's bad, we need  to get away
    from here before it notices us"
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, we need to report this once we get back. I did not  know the
    creatures could cross the barrier"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran grabbed his sister, and just when he was about to  start running, a
    feminine voice floated towards him like a warm summer's rain.
</p>
<p>
    "You guys are not as hidden as you think you are, you know,"  said the girl.
    Kieran turned towards the clearing, watching the girl slowly walk  towards
    him. The monster was nowhere to be seen. Did she defeat the monster all  on
    her own? Kieran had no clue. At least they did not have to worry about the
    monster anymore.
</p>
<p>
    "Who are you?" asked Kieran, staring at the girl, who was now  close enough
    to be visible. Her face was still partially covered by her hoodie.  He was
    not sure if they could trust her, but all he could do in the moment was  to
    keep the conversation going, and slowly plan his retreat.
</p>
<p>
    In response, the girl lowered her hoodie, letting locks of  brown hair spill
    past her shoulders. As her face was fully revealed, Kieran  found himself
    momentarily taken aback. She really was cute, with striking  features that
    suited her confidence.
</p>
<p>
    "I am Elena, one of the members of the Eclipse Seekers,  Division 5"
</p>
<p>
    'And what about the monster you just fought?" asked Kiara, looking  around
    the clearing for any signs of ambush.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, don't worry about that," said Elena. "It's just a manifestation  of my
    power, and won't harm anyone."
</p>
<p>
    "That means you guys are from the group which my brother Kieran  wanted to
    join" Kiara turned to Kieran and smirked. "Unfortunately, he does not  have
    any powers, and neither do I."
</p>
<p>
    "Wait a second, did you just say Kieran? Is your name Kiara  by any chance?"
</p>
<p>
    Kiara's surprise was visible on her face. Kieran had no idea  how did
    someone from a mysterious group knew their names.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, my name is Kiara, and that's Kieran" replied Kiara,  with a guarded
    voice. "How do you even know about us anyway?"
</p>
<p>
    "Uhm, this is bit of a secret, and I am sure I will get into  trouble for
    telling you guys this, but you were actually on the list to be  recruited
    into our organization. Elena stared at the ground, seemingly lost in
    thought. "I don't know the full story as I am a relatively new member myself
    but yeah, you guys are meant to be with us."
</p>
<p>
    "So, you are saying we have powers then?" said Kieran. There  was no way he
    had any powers. When he was younger, he wished desperately to be  able to go
    beyond the barrier and do something useful for the city, but as he  grew
    older, he realized that nothing can change the fact that he is powerless,
    so he had cast away his dreams.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, it is just dormant, and can be awakened," said Elena. "Actually,  it
    seems like majority of the population have the power, but it is usually too
    weak  to even be of use for most people. Anyway, I should get you guys to
    our  headquarters, before the other organizations try to recruit you."
</p>
<p>
    "Why have we not been contacted by other organizations at  all? Asked Kiara.
</p>
<p>
    His sister was right, Kieran had never been contacted by  anyone claiming to
    have powers like this at all.
</p>
<p>
    "No clue," replied Elena. "I just heard that all such  organizations who
    form a collection of people like us, were banned from ever  contacting you."
</p>
<p>
    "Ah you are going to be in huge trouble then" said Kiara,  displaying a warm
    smile. "Shall we go with Elena and see what happens, Kieran?"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran could not think of any objections. He wanted to get  the full truth
    behind whatever is happening, and he knew the only way for that  was to go
    along with Elena, and question the organization directly. "Not like  you are
    going to listen if I say otherwise Ki"
</p>
<p>
    "You are right about that!" laughed Kiara, heading after  Elena.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran hesitated a bit before stepping forward. There was no  turning back
    now, he needed to know how to use his powers, that was his dream  after all.
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  2
</p>
<p>
    "Hey Elena, how do you plan to get back to your  headquarters?" asked
    Kieran. "Going to the city is impossible this late at  night"
</p>
<p>
    "Our headquarters is pretty close by actually," said Elena.  "It should be
    about an hour of walking from here"
</p>
<p>
    "No way, if it was located here, we would have definitely  seen it," said
    Kiara. "We come here every week to load supplies from different  parts of
    the farmlands."
</p>
<p>
    "You will be surprised" Elena smiled. "Come, it's just a  little further
    now"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran slowly made his way towards the location of the headquarters
    following Elena. He had no idea how a set of buildings can be hidden that
    easily. Kieran could not see anything resembling any headquarters. Verdant
    horizons stretched endlessly before him, lit by the silver moonlight. It had
    been nearly an hour since they started walking, and they did not reach
    anything  yet.
</p>
<p>
    Kiara turned back towards Kieran, giving him a questioning  look. "I am
    pretty sure we have come in this general location, and absolutely  nothing
    was here."
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, I wonder how they hide their headquarters"
</p>
<p>
    "We have reached the headquarters" announced Elena. "Now  watch me carefully
    as I show you the entrance."
</p>
<p>
    Elena stepped forward, resting her hands against an invisible  wall. Kieran
    tried walking towards the wall, but Elena extended her hand  towards him,
    blocking his way.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't do that" warned Elena. "It's an illusion barrier,  which will confuse
    your sense of surroundings, if you are not integrated with a  Nightshroud
    crystal."
</p>
<p>
    Kieran jumped back, keeping a healthy distance from the barrier.  Elena
    walked around for a while, till she stopped in her tracks, her hands  still
    on the barrier.
</p>
<p>
    "Found the switch," said Elena, flipping the switch. "This  will disable the
    barrier, so that you two can come inside"
</p>
<p>
    The entire barrier rippled, and slowly faded out of  existence. An entire
    sea of buildings stood in the place where previously there  was nothing. It
    was a sight to behold indeed. Kieran could not see anyone  nearby currently.
    The entire place was lit up by soft yellow street lights,  similar to the
    ones in the city. Kiara similarly was staring at the city in  surprise.
</p>
<p>
    "Welcome to The Eclipse Seekers!" said Elena, giving Kieran  and his sister
    a proud smile. "How do you like it?"
</p>
<p>
    "I did not expect this at all," said Kiara. "I though you  would take a
    portal or something to the headquarter."
</p>
<p>
    "Unfortunately, no one knows how to make portal anymore,"  said Elena. "The
    ones in the city are just linked to the few cities near us, as  you might
    know."
</p>
<p>
    Kieran had seen the 4 portals that people used to travel  between the linked
    cities, but he and Kiara were not allowed to travel outside  the city by
    their parents.
</p>
<p>
    "Now what do we do? Asked Kieran. "This place is barely  guarded for such a
    secret headquarter."
</p>
<p>
    "That is how much they trust the barrier," said Elena. "I  shall put it back
    up, and we shall head to my accommodation for the night. I  don't want to
    get yelled at by the leaders right now, so we shall deal with it  tomorrow."
</p>
<p>
    Kieran would have normally hesitated going to a girl's room  this late at
    night but thankfully, his sister was there to prevent any  awkwardness.
    Noticing the look on his face, Kiara turned towards him. He  instantly
    realised that Kiara being here was the worst possible thing to happen.
</p>
<p>
    "Feeling shy are we, Kieran?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh no, nothing like that" Kieran casually moved beside Kiara,  pulling her
    away from Elena. "It's getting late, we need to be well rested  before
    tomorrow"
</p>
<p>
    Elena, who was watching the exchange just smiled. "Kieran is  right, let's
    get going!"
</p>
<p>
    Elena started heading towards her house. Kieran turned  towards his sister
    and whispered. "I shall get you back for that, you wait"
</p>
<p>
    Laughing, Kiara started walking towards Elena, leaving Kieran  to slowly
    take in the sights of the city. There were many different buildings located
    there, and many of them were residential buildings. The main feature of the
    area was the guild headquarters, which Kieran could see in the distance. It
    stretched above the other buildings, standing tall amidst the smaller
    buildings.
</p>
<p>
    After a short walk, Elena stopped in front of a small building.  It was a
    small apartment style building.
</p>
<p>
    "Here we are," said Elena. "Make yourselves at home"
</p>
<p>
    "Damn, its much bigger than I expected," said Kieran, taking  a quick look
    at the building. It looked old, but also cozy in a sense.
</p>
<p>
    "Even new recruits get houses like this?" continued Kiara.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, since we barely have any members," said Elena, as she  entered her
    house, and switched on the lights. A warm glow illuminated the  space as
    light flooded the area. The apartment consisted of a living room, with  a
    small bedroom at the side. "The top leaders have much bigger houses, closer
    to the guild headquarters, but most members live in places like this."
</p>
<p>
    "Looks like being a member comes with some amazing perks  indeed!" said
    Kiara, as she took in the surroundings.
</p>
<p>
    "The dangers balance it out" Elena let out a short laugh, but  Kieran
    noticed the way her fingers tightened against the mattress she was  holding.
    "Anyway, I have pulled out these spare beds for you guys. If you need
    anything, just call me, I shall be in my room."
</p>
<p>
    Kiara gave Elena a small nod. "Thanks, Elena. You should get  some rest
    too."
</p>
<p>
    "Goodnight then, Elena" said Kieran, heading for the bed. He  was exhausted
    from all the walking, but he was curious to know about what  really was this
    organization, and what Elena meant by dangers. He would be  finding out soon
    enough.
</p>
<p align="center">
    ***
</p>
<p>
    Morning sunlight streamed into the room, waking up Kieran  from his sleep.
    Kiara was still sleeping. She always used to wake up pretty  late, and it
    was Kieran's everyday routine dragging her out of bed for their  work.
</p>
<p>
    "Up already huh? We need to get going then" said Elena, who  was sitting on
    the couch, reading something.
</p>
<p>
    "Kiara is not going to wake up anytime soon," said Kieran, heading  over to
    Kiara and giving her a shake. "Wake up, we have stuff to do"
</p>
<p>
    Kiara jumped out of her bed, and without a pause, folded her  mattress to
    put it away, leaving Kieran in stunned silence.
</p>
<p>
    "That's a record breaking wake up time right there Ki," said  Kieran,
    putting away his own mattress too.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, we have a busy day ahead of us, you know."
</p>
<p>
    With a resigned shake of his head, Kieran got ready to leave.  Once they had
    finished with the pack of instant noodles provided by Elena, they  started
    heading out towards the headquarters. There were many people out and  about,
    and quite a few of them cast curious glances at Kieran and his sister.
</p>
<p>
    "I am pretty sure news about you guys would have reached the headquarters,"
    said Elena. "Just explain yourselves calmly and you should be fine"
</p>
<p>
    The main building of the headquarters loomed before Kieran,  tall and
    imposing. It was of a similar design to the city square, just a lot bigger.
    Elena went ahead of him, and cracked open the door, revealing the insides of
    the hall. It was ornately decorated, with huge pillars and designs
    everywhere.  At the end of the hall, there were four figures standing,
    glaring at Elena with  a sharp look. It looked like they were not happy to
    see Kieran and his sister  there at all.
</p>
<p>
    "Elena, may I know what the Solvaris siblings are doing here"  said a figure
    in the middle, his voice laced with anger. He was wearing a robe  the shade
    of the setting sun.
</p>
<p>
    "I am truly sorry Captain Tianxi." Said Elena, carefully  staring at the
    floor. "They ended up catching me practicing my fighting out in  the fields"
</p>
<p>
    "All you had to do is ignore them, and move on" Tianxi  sighed, turning his
    gaze to Kieran and Kiara. "Please forget about us. If we let  you guys in,
    your parents will make sure to shut this organization down."
</p>
<p>
    "Our parents? They are not anywhere near the city," said  Kiara. "They said
    they had something important to do, and went away about half  a year back.
    There is no way they will even bother shutting you down, just  because we
    are here."
</p>
<p>
    Tianxi's face was a portrait of surprise. "Wait, that does  not sound like
    them, are you guys in contact at least?"
</p>
<p>
    "They message once in a while" replied Kieran. "Enough about  that, are you
    guys letting us in or not?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not formally, that will get all the other organizations after  us" said
    Tianxi. "We do have a better idea, since Elena was the one who brought  you
    guys here, she will be assigned to train you as punishment. Make sure to
    keep them safe Elena."
</p>
<p>
    Elena took a deep bow. "I shall make sure to protect them  till they can use
    their Nightshroud powers properly, Captain Tianxi."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Tianxi headed towards Kieran, and handed him a  spherical object. It
    looked like a cloud was swirling inside it, giving off a  faint blue glow.
    He handed a similar glowing sphere to Kiara too.
</p>
<p>
    "Elena will teach you how to use it" said Tianxi. "You may  use an empty
    apartment as your base. We will assign one close to Elena's. You  are
    dismissed"
</p>
<p>
    "One last question" interjected Kieran. "Who were my parents  even?"
</p>
<p>
    Tianxi and the other leaders just gave Kieran a soft look  before turning
    away. "Nope, we have no idea who they are. Please be on your way  now."
</p>
<p>
    Giving them a quick bow, Kieran slowly started making his way  for the exit.
    It was clear they were hiding something, but he had no idea how  to get the
    truth from them.
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  3
</p>
<p>
    Kieran was seated at a restaurant table, across Elena and  Kiara. They had
    headed straight to a restaurant that Elena recommended, so he  was treating
    them to lunch. His Nightshroud crystal was still tightly held in  his hands.
    Kieran brought it closer, watching the clouds of blue swirl and flow  within
    it.
</p>
<p>
    "So, this will unlock our powers huh?"
</p>
<p>
    "A part of it, yeah," said Elena. "A blue crystal is used  just for basic
    protection. If you want to see true power, you will have to find  yourself a
    purple or red one."
</p>
<p>
    "And they did not have any red crystals at the headquarter to  give us?"
    said Kiara, her face an expression of disbelief.
</p>
<p>
    "Nope" replied Elena, her face darkening "The last time we  tried to get a
    red one went very badly. We just don't have enough people here  to handle
    multiple Nightshroud of that level."
</p>
<p>
    Kieran quickly changed the topic on catching her expression.  He then
    started asking her about the other members who were a part of the  Eclipse
    Seekers.
</p>
<p>
    "Our organization is barely holding on compared to the ones  in other
    cities," said Elena. "I'm the only blue crystal user in our age group,  the
    vast majority of them are just green crystals."
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't the leaders just give out a blue crystal to  everyone like they
    did to us?" said Kieran. Something did not seem right about  just being
    given a blue crystal that easily.
</p>
<p>
    "I think, for most people, anything higher than a green crystal  just gets
    rejected by their bodies instantly," said Elena. "I was given a green
    crystal at first, but upgraded to a blue crystal that I found during that
    raid  I mentioned earlier."
</p>
<p>
    "So, what about us? We have a blue crystal," said Kiara. "You  think it will
    get rejected?"
</p>
<p>
    "The leaders think that you guys should be fine starting off  with a blue
    crystal," said Elena. "They know what they are doing I suppose. Anyway,  we
    shall see how well you integrate once we get the process started."
</p>
<p>
    Once they were done with their food, Elena took them straight  to an arena,
    which Kieran recalled seeing on his way to the headquarters. There  were
    already a few people in there, most of them looked a bit older than him.
</p>
<p>
    A guy with soft black hair and brown eyes glanced over as  they approached.
    Behind him stood a brown-haired guy and a silver-haired girl  with striking
    green eyes.
</p>
<p>
    "Hey Elena, who are those people with you" The black-haired  guy asked. "The
    girl is such a cutie; can I date her?"
</p>
<p>
    Kiara let out a quiet laugh, clearly entertained, but Kieran  wasn't as
    amused. "Please do not flirt with my sister."
</p>
<p>
    Before the guy could respond, the brown-haired guy sighed and  reached over,
    giving his ear a sharp tug. "Ignore Jin. He flirts with  everything that
    moves,"
</p>
<p>
    Shaking her head, Elena replied. "It's Kieran and Kiara, I  think should
    explain everything." Turning to Kieran and Kiara, she gestured  towards the
    trio. "These are Jin, Cillian, and Isla. They have been members for  a long
    time now."
</p>
<p>
    Isla whistled. "No wonder the leaders were cranky today when  we met them.
    You managed to recruit them huh?"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, not formally," said Elena. "We are supposed to keep  them associated
    with the Eclipse Seekers, so they assigned a new member like me  to train
    them."
</p>
<p>
    Kieran decided to try his luck getting information out of  these members.
    They all were talking about him and Kiara as if they were some  important
    people, but the leaders did not answer at all.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran turned his gaze towards Isla. "I asked the leaders  this, and got no
    reply. Who are my parents anyway?"
</p>
<p>
    "See, from what I heard, they were bigshots around these parts,"  said Isla.
    "Don't know anything more than that though."
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, that was obvious enough, seeing the way we are being treated,"  said
    Kiara. "So even you guys don't know anything else huh?"
</p>
<p>
    "I shall ask the leaders for more information if you want,"  said Isla. "I
    shall update you if I learn anything new"
</p>
<p>
    Giving her a quick nod, Kiara turned towards Elena. "Now  please show us how
    to integrate with this crystal here."
</p>
<p>
    "It's a simple process," said Elena. "Hold out the crystal  close to you,
    and try visualizing your strength flowing into it."
</p>
<p>
    Kieran held the crystal close to him, trying to follow  Elena's
    instructions. He did not know what visualizing strength was meant to  be,
    but he just meditated and focused on his wish of always wanting something
    similar to this. After nearly a minute, the weight on his hands suddenly
    vanished, leaving behind no trace of the crystal. His sister did not have
    the  crystal either. He could hear the sounds of clapping from the others
    who were  present in the arena.
</p>
<p>
    "With that, you are successfully integrated with the  crystal," said Elena.
    "Now if you wait for a bit, a creature should pop into  existence, which
    will protect you"
</p>
<p>
    With a bright flash of light, two creatures materialized in  front of
    Kieran. The one closest to him looked like a medium sized dragon, but  it
    did not have wings. The other creature resembled a giant armoured snake.
    That one probably belonged to Kiara, as it slithered to her, checking her
    out.
</p>
<p>
    Kiara did not show any hesitation in straight up hugging the  giant snake.
    "A giant magic snake for a pet? It's my lucky day!"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran's own Nightshroud was staring curiously at him, as if  waiting for
    something. he stepped closer, reaching out his hand toward his Nightshroud.
    It hesitated for a moment before taking slow, steady steps forward. Finally,
    it  allowed him to touch it. Its skin felt strong yet flexible, cool beneath
    his  fingertips. Suddenly, a flash interrupted his vision. It looked like
    Elena  decided to bring out her Nightshroud as well.
</p>
<p>
    Elena's Nightshroud was a huge bearlike creature, which  Kieran recalled
    catching a glimpse of earlier. It took a defensive stance in  front of
    Elena, eyeing the new Nightshrouds carefully. Elena slowly ran her  hands
    across its fur, petting the creature to calm it down.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't worry Biero, they are our friends," said Elena. "We  will be going on
    missions with them"
</p>
<p>
    Seemingly having calmed down, Biero started playfighting with  Kieran's
    Nightshroud, as well as Kiara's. Meanwhile Kieran knew he needed to  settle
    on a name fast. He went through a few names before settling on Atsuki,  as
    he liked how it sounded.
</p>
<p>
    "Ki, did you name your Nightshroud yet?
</p>
<p>
    Kiara who was staring at her Nightshroud, turned to Kieran.  "Obviously, it
    is named Viperion."
</p>
<p>
    "It's a name so generic, that only you could have come up  with" said
    Kieran, dodging his sister's look of outrage. Viperion sounded like  a name
    of a ship or something to him, though he kept that thought to himself.
</p>
<p>
    "I will take the name Viperion any day over Atsuki" she  replied, heading
    over to Viperion. Elena, who was talking to Isla and the  others, waved
    Kieran over.
</p>
<p>
    "We shall set out for a mission in a few days. That shall be  a good
    opportunity for you guys to train your Nightshrouds"
</p>
<p>
    "Alright then" said Kieran, watching as the Nightshrouds  finished playing,
    and headed towards them. It was nearly the end of the day,  and they had to
    go back. After saying his goodbyes to Jin and the others,  Kieran, Kiara,
    and Elena headed back to the house they were staying in.
</p>
<p>
    To his surprise, Kieran saw a house in that same street,  fully prepared and
    open. There were a few workers standing there.
</p>
<p>
    "We were instructed to ready this house for Kieran and Kiara,"  said a
    worker. "This will be where you two will be staying from now on"
</p>
<p>
    On entering the house, Kieran could see it was an exact copy  of Elena's
    house, but there were two rooms instead of one. Kiara headed to the bigger
    room, which was located in the corner of the house and claimed it.
</p>
<p>
    "This shall be my room," said Kiara. "You can have the  smaller one there."
</p>
<p>
    Whatever, Kieran did not necessarily want a bigger room, so  he was fine
    with it. He planned to be out and about most of the time anyway.  Sighing,
    he headed to his room, and saw it was already prepared with blankets  and
    everything else.
</p>
<p>
    "Wow" said Elena, who was sitting in a couch, watching the  others explore
    the house. "You guys sure do get VIP treatment huh? The quality  of the
    items here seems top notch. I am claiming this as place as my main  hangout
    spot"
</p>
<p>
    Laughing, Kieran returned from his room, and plopped down on  the couch next
    to Elena. "Feel free to stay here whenever you want miss Elena"
</p>
<p>
    "I intend to make full use of this opportunity" said Elena, playfully
    swatting at Kieran. "Anyway, I need to get going, we shall meet again
    tomorrow  morning"
</p>
<p>
    Elena got up and waved, heading for the exit.
</p>
<p>
    "Goodnight, Elena!" said Kiara, watching as her figure  disappeared into the
    night.
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  4
</p>
<p>
    The next few days went by in a flash. It mostly involved  Elena showing
    Kieran and Kiara around the headquarters. Occasionally, they ran  into Isla
    and her friends, but they seemed very busy, barely even present in  the
    headquarters. The leaders were also were missing from the headquarters,
    with some others standing in for them, people who Kieran did not see
    earlier.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran used the time to practice with Atsuki, just like Elena  did. They
    were not allowed to fight each other, but solo practice seemed just  as
    helpful. Finally, the day of the mission arrived. They were hanging out at
    Kieran's place, discussing the plan of action.
</p>
<p>
    "Depending on how well this mission goes, you will get to  keep any purple
    crystals you claim from there," said Elena. "The leaders do  have purple
    crystals at the headquarters, but it is only given after a year of  being a
    member due to how rare it is."
</p>
<p>
    "Do you think we will be able to take out Nightshrouds of  purple level,"
    said Kieran. He kept his voice even, but he could not shake off feeling
    that they would be wiped out instantly the second they were attacked. The
    Nightshrouds were dangerous creatures after all.
</p>
<p>
    Elena responded quickly. Far too quickly in fact, but Kieran caught  the
    slight tremor in her voice. "Well, the place we are going to is already
    scouted out by Isla and her group. There is just a single purple crystal
    Nightshroud there. The three of us should be more than enough to take it
    out."
</p>
<p>
    Before Kieran could say anything, Kiara started heading  towards the door.
    "Perfect then, let's get the purple crystal's power for ourselves,"
</p>
<p>
    Elena caught her by the arm. "Hold on, we need to get the  weapons from the
    headquarters before we leave."
</p>
<p>
    Kiara nodded, and they started walking towards the  headquarters main
    building. As they walked through the empty halls, Kieran's  unease deepened.
    The air around him was too quiet, all sounds swallowed up by  the vast
    emptiness.
</p>
<p>
    The leaders were not present here, again.
</p>
<p>
    The halls slowly darkened, leading to a corridor of some  sort. It stretched
    before him, dim and uncertain.
</p>
<p>
    "What is this place even?" asked Kieran, taking in the passageway  around
    him.
</p>
<p>
    "Our armoury is up ahead," said Elena. "It was designed this  way as a
    security measure. I should be able to find some spare ANGs over there"
</p>
<p>
    "ANG? Kiara tilted her head. "What's that"
</p>
<p>
    "It's short for Anti Nightshroud Guns," Elena explained "It's  very easy to
    use, so no training is required."
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the corridor, Kieran could see a huge metal  door standing in
    their way. Elena headed to it and pushed it. With a few creaks  of protest,
    the door swung open revealing a room full of guns. Kieran reached  for the
    nearest one, running his fingers across the steampunk inspired design.  It
    felt well balanced in his hands.
</p>
<p>
    "This almost feels like a game" said Kiara, spinning her gun,  before
    pointing it at random objects.
</p>
<p>
    Elena gave Kiara a sharp glare. "If you fire it by mistake,  it will blow up
    this entire building"
</p>
<p>
    Kiara hastily lowered her gun, giving a sheepish smile  "Almost forgot this
    is a real weapon, my bad"
</p>
<p>
    Shaking her head, Elena grabbed a weapon of her own from the  wall, and
    turned towards Kieran, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.
</p>
<p>
    "Come, lets pull off a successful mission for once"
</p>
<p>
    Leaving the armoury, they headed outside. After a bit of a  walk, they
    reached the edge of the headquarter barrier. From the inside, it looked
    like a translucent wall, shimmering and swirling ahead of Kieran. Kiara gave
    it  a cautious look, keeping her distance from it.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on, the barrier will allow you guys to leave and enter  now" said Elena,
    vanishing out of sight after crossing the barrier. Kieran soon  followed,
    along with Kiara, and they were out of the Eclipse Seeker  Headquarters.
    Kieran could see no sign of entire area even existing.
</p>
<p>
    "Well then, the city barrier is about ten minutes from here,  and the raid
    location is twenty minutes away from there," said Elena in a  business-like
    tone, checking the route on her phone.
</p>
<p>
    "Hold on, let me send you the route." Elena looked through  her phone before
    pausing. "I never did get your contact detail did I, Kieran? I  have your
    sister's as she gave me hers a few days back"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran took his phone out, navigating to the connections  page, and held it
    out to Elena. "Here you go."
</p>
<p>
    Elena quickly added his details to the chat app, and send him  the route.
    Kieran opened to find the route neatly marked on his map. As he  glanced at
    the chat icons, his stomach dropped. His profile picture.
</p>
<p>
    With a jolt of horror, Kieran realised that Elena was now  looking right at
    it.
</p>
<p>
    "Nice profile picture, Kieran" Elena remarked, her voice  laced with
    amusement. "Very creative of you indeed"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran quickly tried thinking of an excuse.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, his profile picture is very unique indeed" added Kiara,  barely
    supressing her laugher. "I think he forgot that even existed"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran could feel himself turning red. He should have changed  it ages ago.
</p>
<p>
    Because right there next to his name, in full display was an  old,
    ridiculous photo of himself, which was edited to look like a warrior,
    fighting some monsters.
</p>
<p>
    "That's an old photo, I just forgot it was there" stammered  out Kieran
</p>
<p>
    Quickly taking out his phone, Kieran tapped the menu panel to  change the
    image. He selected some random flower pictures and set that. He was  too
    late, but he hoped this would help him to prevent further embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah, he changed it," said Elena. "Very unfortunate indeed"
</p>
<p>
    "No worries" replied Kiara. "I shall send you the photo if  you want."
</p>
<p>
    "Please do," said Elena, barely holding back her laugher.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran sighed. All he could do now was to wait till they  forgot about it.
    Anyway, he had bigger things to worry about. They had reached  the city
    barrier, and they were finally exiting the city for once.
</p>
<p>
    Elena stopped right in front of the barrier. "Now then, we  just have a bit
    more to go. Keep your weapons ready"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran was greeted with the same drab view he saw ages ago.  The sky burned
    through the red desert in front of him. Kieran could feel  himself sweating,
    it was boiling hot. Beside him, Kiara was staring at the landscape  outside
    in wonder. This was Kiara's first time seeing it. This was all new to  her,
    but Kieran had already seen it before.
</p>
<p>
    "There is a whole desert outside out city," said Kiara. "I am  surprised our
    city is even surviving in this heat. The barrier is doing an  amazing job
    indeed."
</p>
<p>
    "That is the reason I told you guys to wear something lighter,"  said Elena.
    She was wearing comfortable clothing, which seemed airy enough.  Kieran had
    to admit it did look good on her, reminding him of the moonlit girl  he saw
    at the clearing.
</p>
<p>
    Elena glanced at Kieran, giving him a questioning look.  "Something's the
    matter?"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran shook his head. "Nope, I just got reminded of the day  when we met
    you, a strange figure dancing through the moonlight."
</p>
<p>
    Elena gave a small smile. "Very poetic indeed, but I was just  practicing my
    movement and battle skills. I wanted to get as strong as possible  you
    know?"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran understood that sentiment. Afterall, he had the same  goal too.
</p>
<p>
    Elena cast a warm gaze at Kieran and his sister. "Now that I  met you guys,
    I finally have a real chance of getting a purple crystal."
</p>
<p>
    "That is exactly we will do" said Kieran firmly. "We can even  get a red
    crystal one day, and be strong enough to even change the world."
</p>
<p>
    Kiara smacked Kieran with a laugh. "Changing the world?  That's a tall order
    indeed," she teased. "But yeah, we will make sure you clear  raids easily,
    Elena"
</p>
<p>
    Elena's expression softened. "Thanks, guys. I didn't even  have to explain
    myself, and you're already supporting me"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran offered a small smiled. "You can always rely on us, no  problem!" he
    said, as they slowly made their way towards the marked location.
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  5
</p>
<p>
    The location that was marked on Elena's map led to a cave-like  structure,
    which was currently looming in front of her, like the maw of an  ancient
    beast. There was no Nightshrouds to be found around, not even the  purple
    one which they were meant to fight. This meant that they had to go  further
    inside the cave systems, or bait them out of the caves.
</p>
<p>
    "Are we supposed to go inside the caves or something?" said  Kieran, with a
    tone that suggested he found the idea interesting.
</p>
<p>
    Elena swatted at Kieran. "That's like going from a frying pan  into the
    fire, you know?"
</p>
<p>
    "Any other ideas then?" asked Kiara.
</p>
<p>
    Elena already knew the best plan of action "Get your  Nightshrouds out, and
    we can bait the creatures outside" Elena summoned her  Nightshroud, bringing
    out Biero with a flash. Biero was soon joined by Atsuki  and Viperion, their
    sleek forms standing like a wall at their sides.
</p>
<p>
    "That will get them rushing here instantly," said Elena. As  if right on
    cue, sounds of rumbling footsteps could be heard emanating from the  caves.
    Hordes of small creatures started pouring out from the caves.
</p>
<p>
    Elena cocked her gun, taking aim. "Our Nightshrouds will take  care of the
    fighting for the most part, we just need to keep firing."
</p>
<p>
    With a deafening bang, her gun fired, wiping out all the creatures  caught
    in the blast. The stench of burning flesh filled her lungs, bringing up
    some memories she kept buried, but she quickly pushed it out of her mind.
    After  all, this wasn't the past, and she was not alone now.
</p>
<p>
    Elena glanced over at Kiara, who was finishing off the  creatures that
    managed to make it past their defence. She carefully guided her  Nightshroud
    to demolish the wild nightshrouds, reducing their numbers one by  one.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile Kieran had gone to the frontlines with his  Nightshroud, and was
    picking off the creatures right as they came outside. Elena  could see he
    had gained a lot more confidence seeing the wild nightshrouds get  blasted
    apart easily.
</p>
<p>
    These were just green level nightshrouds though. Elena knew  real trouble
    would start once the blue ones arrive. Even if they could not do  any magic,
    they were really hardy. Then there was the object of their mission,  the
    purple Nightshroud, which was capable of doing some nasty elemental magic.
    Elena sighed. She just hoped the three of them were enough to take it on.
</p>
<p>
    Slowly, the flow of the green nightshrouds started dying down.  Elena could
    see the dead bodies of the nightshrouds scattered all around. The  cave was
    silent, providing a short relief from the constant battle.
</p>
<p>
    Elena took a deep breath before calling out "Kieran, Kiara,  regroup!"
</p>
<p>
    "The blue nightshrouds will be here soon," Elena continued,  scanning the
    dead creatures lying in front of her. "Behind them will be the  purple
    nightshrouds. Just be careful, as they can blow us up with pure magical
    energy"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran approached Elena, his Nightshroud following him  gracefully. "We
    shall bring them down for sure." He said, his voice steady.
</p>
<p>
    Elena, Kieran, and Kiara stood ready, their weapons pointed  right at the
    cave. Their nightshrouds were standing right in front of them,  waiting for
    an attack. The cave rumbled again, announcing the arrival of something  far
    larger than before.
</p>
<p>
    With a loud roar, nightshrouds the size of Elena's own  Nightshroud started
    pouring out of the cave. Elena took aim and fired, her shot  hitting the
    Nightshroud point blank. It froze, stunned by the impact and fell  over
    unmoving.
</p>
<p>
    "That did not even kill it?" said Kiara, her grip tightening  on her gun
    "How are we supposed to kill them anyway?"
</p>
<p>
    "As long as we stun them, our Nightshrouds will take care of  the rest,"
    said Elena. She looked at Biero, and pointed to the fallen creature,  giving
    Biero a silent command.
</p>
<p>
    Instantly, Biero started heading towards the wild Nightshroud,  the other
    Nightshrouds following it. With a vicious slash, they tore into the
    creature, ripping it apart in seconds.
</p>
<p>
    "There we go," said Elena. "Take out as many nightshrouds as  you can,
    before the purple creature arrives."
</p>
<p>
    Elena focused her gun on the rapidly moving targets, taking  them down one
    by one. Each time a wild Nightshroud fell, her Nightshroud finished  it off
    with brutal efficiency.
</p>
<p>
    To her left, Kieran fired his gun with sharp precision, blasting  through
    the creatures. His Nightshroud was having a bit of trouble matching his
    moments, but that was to be expected for an inexperienced Nightshroud. Kiara
    fought nearby, Viperion protecting her from any nightshrouds by dispatching
    them instantly.
</p>
<p>
    Just when Elena thought they were done with the blue nightshrouds,  A loud
    roar shook the earth. A large figure emerged, crawling out of the cave.
    Elena  could see its pincers clicking ominously, as its eyes rapidly scanned
    the  environment.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran and Kiara, who were near her, had stopped fighting,  and were staring
    at the giant ant, their faces wearing an expression of  surprise. Right,
    this was their first time seeing a full-size purple Nightshroud  unlike her.
    Elena had seen even bigger creatures, which were the red nightshrouds.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran turned to Elena with a questioning look. "How do you  think we are
    supposed to defeat this?"
</p>
<p>
    "Make sure to avoid the attacks of the Ant" said Elena,  pointing her gun on
    the creature. "If we keep firing continuously, it should  tire out
    eventually"
</p>
<p>
    The constant barrage of the firing weapons caught the  attention of the
    antlike creature. It focused its attention on them, letting  out a huge
    roar. Elena shivered. She never expected a sound like that to come  from an
    ant.
</p>
<p>
    Without warning, jagged spikes of ice started heading towards  them at full
    speed. Elena barely had the time to react, Biero and the other  Nightshrouds
    jumped in front of them, shattering the ice shards with a powerful  strike.
    Splinters of ice lay scattered around them, releasing a cold mist.
</p>
<p>
    Kiara whistled. "So that's the power of a purple Nightshroud  crystal huh?"
    Her eyes gleamed, unfazed by the danger.
</p>
<p>
    Elena exhaled slowly. "If you don't keep moving, this will be  the last time
    you get to see it" she threw Kiara a quick smile.
</p>
<p>
    Magic had never been kind to Elena, but she supposed that  there was
    something fascinating about watching it for the first time.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, my sister has no sense of danger at all," said Kieran,  shaking his
    head at Kiara. He looked much more shaken up over the close call.  Elena
    could see his gun shaking slightly.
</p>
<p>
    "Anyway, watch out for the next set of attacks," said Elena.  "It will start
    firing the ice shards again soon"
</p>
<p>
    With that, Elena waited for the next attack. The ant's gaze  was narrowed at
    them, hate clearly visible through its glare. It roared again,  sending
    another round of ice missiles at them. Elena was prepared this time,
    sending gunfire right at the ant's face. The creature staggered, losing
    control  of the ice missiles. Their Nightshrouds easily took care of the few
    shards  which did come close.
</p>
<p>
    Beside her, Elena could see Kieran and Kiara doing the same  thing. They
    fired shots directly at the ant's face, staggering it enough to  make it
    lose its aim. It tried firing a few more shards, but barely any of it  came
    near them. It looked like they were winning at last, but Elena was sure it
    had a few more tricks up its sleeve.
</p>
<p>
    "It is preparing for a heavier attack," Elena shouted out a  warning. "Be
    careful everyone"
</p>
<p>
    Just as she suspected, the ant now started roaring, screaming  something in
    a guttural voice. Elena cursed her luck. This creature was  probably closer
    to a red Nightshroud being than a purple Nightshroud being,  seeing that it
    could do an area wide spell.
</p>
<p>
    The sky turned grey, dark clouds gathering in the sky. They  all kept firing
    at the ant, to kill it before it could finish its spell.  Abruptly, the
    creature stopped as if exhausted. It glanced at them with a  strange
    expression and fell over. The sky instantly cleared, returning to the
    orange sunset which was there earlier.
</p>
<p>
    It looked like they had won. Elena had no clue how to stop a  red level
    spell, and she was thankful that it died before the spell could be
    completed.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran who was staring at the sky, turned to Elena. "Do you  have any idea
    what that was about?"
</p>
<p>
    Elena sighed. "All I can say is, we got lucky. That Nightshroud  was an
    upper purple level. A red Nightshroud can easily use area wide spells  like
    this in an instant."
</p>
<p>
    "Now, how are we supposed to extract the Nightshroud  crystal?" said Kiara,
    staring at the corpse of the giant ant. She headed a bit  closer to the ant,
    looking at it with a curious expression.
</p>
<p>
    "Just wait a bit and look what happens," said Elena. This was  the best part
    of a raid, and according to her, it was something that one should
    experience with their own eyes.
</p>
<p>
    As Elena watched the fallen antlike creature, it started  glowing brightly.
    A stream of glittery purple substance started rising out of  the giant
    creatures. Similarly, all around them, the bodies of the dead nightshrouds
    started glowing, and releasing streams of coloured dust which swirled all
    around them, like millions of fireflies. It headed high up into the sky,
    condensing into a sphere, which then slowly floated down.
</p>
<p>
    Elena quickly headed towards the purple Nightshroud sphere,  and caught it
    gently in her hands. She let out a sigh of relief. Finally,  something she
    had been wanting for so long was right in her hands, and all they  had to do
    was to get back safely to the headquarters. She turned to Kieran and  Kiara,
    who was inspecting the other Nightshroud crystals.
</p>
<p>
    "That was beautiful indeed," said Kiara mesmerized by the  display. She then
    turned to Elena with a smirk. "Now you are officially a  purple crystal user
    huh?"
</p>
<p>
    "We all are" Elena corrected, glancing at the both of them.  "Since we
    defeated the creature together, you should be able to integrate with  a
    purple Nightshroud without any problems. The leaders will be willing to
    spare  you two some purple crystals"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran grinned. "Ah perfect, that means we can go on even  more raids"
</p>
<p>
    Elena just smiled, shaking her head slowly. Now that she had  such a strong
    team put together, she hoped she could get strong enough to find  out the
    truth of why her city was attacked, all those years back.
</p>
<p>
    Turning, Elena took a few steps forward away from the carnage  when
    suddenly, the sky went completely dark. She glanced at the sky in alarm.
    Dark clouds now covered the evening sky, blotting out any light from
    reaching  them. Where did a red Nightshroud bring appear from? Elena spun
    around, checking  if something new emerged from the cave, but it was just as
    silent as before.
</p>
<p>
    Kiara gave Elena a confused glance. "What just happened? I  can barely see
    you"
</p>
<p>
    "It looks like our luck has run out," said Elena, glaring at  the sky. "The
    only thing we can do now is to run, before the red Nightshroud appears."
</p>
<p>
    "Can't we just get on our Nightshrouds, and escape easily?"  asked Kieran,
    already starting to climb Atsuki.
</p>
<p>
    "That is like running with a beacon," said Elena, dismissing  Biero with a
    wave. "It will point our location out to every creature nearby"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran hurriedly dismissed his Nightshroud, and Kiara did the  same. Once
    that was done, Elena and the others started running at full speed  towards
    the city barrier.  Unfortunately,  they still had a lot of ground to cover.
    Glancing behind her, Elena could see  Kieran and Kiara struggling to keep
    up.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran was panting hard, and Kiara was slowing down  considerably. It
    certainly looked like they were not used to running at all. It  was fine
    though. Elena could not see any creatures nearby at all. The sky still
    remained stubbornly dark, but at least they were safe enough for now.
</p>
<p>
    After a while of this mad dash, Elena could see the city come  into view in
    the distance. It was just a matter of time now, and it looked like  they
    could get away unscathed. She slowed down, letting the others catch their
    breaths.
</p>
<p>
    "Ow, my everything hurts" said Kiara in between breaths.
</p>
<p>
    Elena smiled, remembering the strict training they put her  through. "You
    will get used to it soon enough after a bit of training" she  said. "This is
    our way of life after all"
</p>
<p>
    Elena turned to Kieran to check up on him. He was staring at  something in
    the distance. Following his gaze, she could see a lone figure  approaching
    them. Alarm bells started ringing in her head, but she could not  realise
    why.
</p>
<p>
    "Is that someone coming to help us or what?" asked Kiara.  "That definitely
    does not look like a Nightshroud."
</p>
<p>
    When the figure approached a bit closer, Elena's memory was  jogged, sending
    a chill down her spine. The figure had a very familiar  inscription on its
    armour.
</p>
<p>
    Elena paled. "Call your Nightshrouds out. We might be in bigger  trouble
    than I thought."
</p>
<p>
    With a flash, Atsuki and Viperion joined Biero, who was  standing in front
    of Elena, taking a defensive pose.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello young lady, Interesting collection of people you got  there"
</p>
<p>
    Elena held her gun aimed steady at the figure's face. "What  business do you
    have with us?"
</p>
<p>
    The strange person let out a cruel smiled, their silver blue  hair shaking
    in the wind. "Calm down a little, would you? I am not here for you  either
    way." The person pointed to Kiaran and his sister. "Those two are the reason
    I am here"
</p>
<p>
    On hearing that, Elena pulled the trigger instantly, sending  a round of
    gunfire directly into the person. Just as she feared though, as the  smoke
    cleared, the person there was still standing there, completely unharmed.
    With a flicker, the person vanished, appearing near Kieran in an instant.
</p>
<p>
    The person's speed was so high, that Elena found it hard to  track them. It
    was clear they had no chance of walking away if this person  decided to
    fight. All she could do was to buy time till someone from the city  noticed.
</p>
<p>
    "How very rude of you, I must say people these days have no  manners at
    all," said the person. They stalked towards Kieran, placing a hand  on him.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran swatted away the hand, eyes fixed on the person. "Who  are you? Are
    you a gold crystal user?"
</p>
<p>
    "Gold crystal user? Oh, you mean those fighters of yours who  steal our
    hearts? No boy, we are the Nightshroud Generals. And today, we come  to
    collect payment for the sins of your parents"
</p>
<p>
    Elena had no idea that there were even sentient nightshrouds.  This just
    raised more questions. Why did they even come for her city? She had  no
    clue.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran did not flinch. "So, you just a Nightshroud after all,  just one that
    can talk."
</p>
<p>
    "Kieran, careful" said Elena, with a note of warning in her  voice.
</p>
<p>
    "If their target was to kill us, they would have killed us  long back," said
    Kiara. "I think Kiaran is counting on that fact"
</p>
<p>
    Kiara was right, but knowing how unpredictable nightshrouds  were in
    general, even Elena would not dare mess with them, even if they were
    sentient.
</p>
<p>
    "What did I say about respect again?" said the Nightshroud.  It raised a
    hand towards Kieran and Kiara, as if to grab them, but suddenly  changed its
    mind. Elena could hear sounds of footsteps. She turned towards the  city to
    see the leaders had arrived, with their nightshrouds ready to attack.
</p>
<p>
    "Consider yourselves lucky kids, I don't have the patience to  fight right
    now. We will meet again!" With a sharp look, the Nightshroud leapt  up,
    speeding up and vanishing from view.
</p>
<p>
    Elena sighed in relief. Crisis averted. All that was left to  do now was to
    grab the leaders and question them.
</p>

    CHAPTER  6
</p>
<p align="center">
    Academy  Arc
</p>
<p>
    Kieran and the others slowly walked back towards the base,  after defeating
    the giant ant. Its crystal was still tightly clutched by Elena,  who was
    walking beside him. The whole raid was really a close call, and the  fact
    that they could have died easily did not escape Kieran. For all his dreams
    about going out and fighting Nightshrouds, he did not expect to feel this
    powerless.
</p>
<p>
    Then there was the strange Nightshroud which could talk.  Kieran had been
    terrified, but he did all he could to keep it focused on him,  to make sure
    the others were protected. Kieran sighed, letting out a slow  breath.
    Somehow the Nightshroud General left them unharmed, raising more  questions.
</p>
<p>
    On reaching the Headquarters, Kieran and the others  immediately headed
    towards the main building to give a status report on their  raid. He knew
    this was the perfect chance to guilt trip the leaders into revealing  more.
    Surely, they knew something at least. And if they didn't? it would be  such
    a shame indeed.
</p>
<p>
    Luckily for Kieran, one of the leaders were present in the  office. She
    looked at them with a questioning look. Kieran looked around for Captain
    Tianxi, but he was nowhere to be found. Beside him, Elena quickly ran to the
    leader, and started giving a quick report of what happened.
</p>
<p>
    "That is all Captain Rin," said Elena. "Now for the elephant  in the room,
    what are even those Nightshrouds that look like humans?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Rin sighed, shaking her head. "I did not expect your  team to run
    into them, though I should have seen it coming. We even made sure  that
    those pesky Nightshroud generals were nowhere near this area" She  continued
    "It's a long story, so please take a seat"
</p>
<p>
    It was annoying indeed that it took such an event to get more  information,
    but Kieran was finally close to the truth at last.
</p>
<p>
    "Do they have something to do with my parents?" questioned  Kieran, taking a
    seat at the seats near the desk along with Kiara. Elena  remained standing
    for some reason, her face holding an expression Kieran had  never seen her
    make before.
</p>
<p>
    "It has everything to do with your parents actually," said Captain  Rin.
    "Back when we were all part of the same team, we eventually faced off
    against one of the Nightshrouds generals, who your father took down. The
    other  generals want revenge I suppose."
</p>
<p>
    No wonder the Nightshroud wanted to kidnap Kieran and his  sister. He did
    wonder though, why didn't they kill him on sight? Did they want to  use him
    as leverage or something?
</p>
<p>
    "Good job telling us this crucial information very early  indeed" said
    Elena, her voice dripping with sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
    "Not our problem, as you were the one who dragged Kieran and  Kiara into
    this mess," said Captain Rin, with an unapologetic look. "I did say  it
    would be dangerous after all"
</p>
<p>
    Elena gave a glare but said nothing, plopping down on the  seat nearby. As
    if to diffuse the situation, Kiara started questioning Captain  Rin.
</p>
<p>
    "Any other information you are not telling us?" said Kiara,  giving the
    captain a pointed look.
</p>
<p>
    "That is all we know," said Captain Rin. "In fact, we did not  even consider
    this as important information, as we made sure you guys won't run  into the
    Nightshroud generals. I have no idea how that creature broke through  all
    our defences. That is the reason we were there at the right moment"
</p>
<p>
    Kieran glanced at Elena, who seemed to have cooled down a bit  after hearing
    this. He understood the feeling. Elena was probably worried that  she got
    them involved in something big. Though, he was the one who had decided  to
    learn more about Nightshrouds, and was well aware of the dangers that came
    with it.
</p>
<p>
    "So where can we even find out more about these Nightshrouds  anyway?" said
    Kieran, with a hint of disappointment. They really did not know  anything
    more. Maybe his parents knew something? He made a mental note to shoot  them
    a message, though he had a feeling they would probably get pretty angry.
</p>
<p>
    "You could try asking the older divisions of the Eclipse  Seekers," said
    Captain Rin. "Divisions one to three consists of people from the  Shadow
    Line, which as you might know, is the military that protects our Capital."
    She paused, as if waiting for questions.
</p>
<p>
    "What about divisions three and four then?" asked Kiara.
</p>
<p>
    "They are made of people from the Nightshroud Hunter Agency,"  said the
    captain. "Our division, as well as division six and seven, comes under  our
    Redhawk government. These three factions are the ones that formed The
    Eclipse  Seekers."
</p>
<p>
    Yeah, it looked easier said than done, but atleast Kieran had  a starting
    point now and a clear target to reach.
</p>
<p>
    The captain continued. "I would recommend going to the Capital,  and asking
    around in division three or four. There is a training academy that  belongs
    to our government there. Just train there for a bit while searching for
    more information."
</p>
<p>
    "What about the first two divisions then?" asked Elena, who  had been
    listening intently beside Kieran.
</p>
<p>
    "They are the most mysterious of the bunch, so I would advise  caution,"
    said captain Rin. "Most of their members are war fanatics, and you  would be
    hard pressed to find a normal one." She got up from her desk, and  started
    putting the books away. "Get going then, once you reach the Capital, we
    leaders shall sort the academy stuff out."
</p>
<p>
    It was late evening by the time they were done. Kieran and  the others
    started heading back towards the house.
</p>
<p>
    "We just settled in the here, and now we have to move all  over again"
    complained Kiara, throwing the door of their house open.
</p>
<p>
    "This house came fully furnished, and all our stuff are still  back at our
    house in the city, what are you even complaining about?" said  Kieran,
    shaking his head. Classic Kiara indeed.
</p>
<p>
    "No, it's just that we barely arrived here a week back, and  we have to
    leave already you know?"
</p>
<p>
    "Atleast we will have Elena with us, so it won't be entirely  unfamiliar"
    said Kieran, nodding at Elena, who smiled back.
</p>
<p>
    "You guys will love it over there, it's much grander than you  might
    expect," said Elena, grabbing an apple that was in a basket over the  table.
    "It even rivals the academy building this city has."
</p>
<p>
    "Have you been there, Elena?" Kieran asked.
</p>
<p>
    Elena nodded, staring at the apple in her hand absently.
</p>
<p>
    Kieran blinked. Wait. He'd always figured she was from  Ansphin. She knew
    all the landmarks and even the places only the locals like  him will know
    about. But now, he wasn't so sure.
</p>
<p>
    "I have been there with my parents. My hometown was a  teleport station away
    from the Capital city." She replied, a dark look passing  over her face.
    What Kieran immediately noticed was that Elena referred to her  hometown
    town in past tense.
</p>
<p>
    There was no way. And yet Kieran was sure he arrived at the  correct
    conclusion. He just did not want to voice it and ruin the mood.  Glancing at
    Kiara, it looked like even she had arrived at the same conclusion.
</p>
<p>
    Elena sighed. "Its fine, it's already been two years already.  My parents
    are alive, and so are the majority of the population, so we consider
    ourselves the lucky ones."
</p>
<p>
    A few years back, there was a breach in the barrier of a  certain city. It
    was all over the news at that time. Kieran could vividly  remember watching
    the updates carefully to see if it would survive or not. Unfortunately,  the
    city was entirely razed by the nightshrouds, but evacuation efforts were
    really successful in saving majority of the population.
</p>
<p>
    "So, you were planning to attend the training academy back  then?" asked
    Kiara, watching Elena place the untouched apple back into the  basket.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, my parents are Nightshroud hunters like us, or atleast  they were
    till they retired after fighting for our city."
</p>
<p>
    "Damn, your parents are heroes then, our parents probably  knew each other
    then." Said Kiara.
</p>
<p>
    Elena gave a small smile "Yes, heroes indeed." She stood. "Anyway,  I need
    to get packing. We need to be up early, or we will miss the train."
</p>
<p>
    Kieran turned to his sister. "Did you hear that Ki? Nice and  early. Got
    it?"
</p>
<p>
    Kiara grabbed the apple and threw it at Kieran, who caught it  deftly, and
    returned it to its basket. "I am never late for this kind of stuff  you
    know?"
</p>
