    CHAPTER  1
</p>
<p>
    Frigid winds blew over a city blanketed in snow. The  landscape glowed a
    faint green, reflecting the aurora lighting up the winter  sky. Suddenly,
    the city lights flickered in warning. Like a wave, all the light  across the
    city slowly faded and went out, causing the rosy glow of the windows  to
    flicker out of existence.
</p>
<p>
    The sudden loss of warmth from the heating system roused Sam  from his
    sleep. The power would not be back on till morning, and he was not  feeling
    sleepy anymore. Sam decided to take a relaxing stroll outside. He had  to be
    as silent as possible, as his parents were sleeping in the room next door.
</p>
<p>
    Throwing on his winter jacket, Sam sneaked across the house  and opened the
    door. A cold gust of wind hit him right in the face, his  reddened cheeks
    the evidence of the winter winds.
</p>
<p>
    Stepping out of his house, Sam decided to head for the park  nearby. The sky
    was lit with aurora, and a splattering colour of stars could be  seen. Sam
    took a seat on a swing and stared at the sky. It was a vacation, and  he did
    not have any classes. A few minutes passed by in silence, when someone  else
    entered the park. A figure dressed in a thick coat could be seen, their
    face hidden by the darkness. From the soft glow of the moonlight, Sam could
    see  the figure poking around at the end of the park, which was thickly
    planted with  trees.
</p>
<p>
    The figure stopped, looking around to see if they were alone.  Somehow,
    missing Sam in the darkness, they continued what they were doing. A  bright
    flash of light emerged from the trees, nearly blinding Sam. When he  looked
    again, the figure had completely vanished. Thinking that they might have
    fallen and dropped their torch, Sam hurried to the area, but could not find
    anyone. He could feel something warm nearby but was not able to locate the
    source.
</p>
<p>
    Turning on his flashlight, he pointed it at the trees, hoping  to find
    something. The beam of light fell on the area, revealing more and more  of
    it. Sam could see some small tracks in the snow, leading up to the middle of
    the woods. The tracks suddenly stopped there. A low dripping noise could be
    heard, the sound of snow melting. The water made its way to Sam, pooling
    around  his feet.
</p>
<p>
    Following the water upstream, Sam got to a place which felt  as if it was
    not winter anymore. A green fog could be seen as if the aurora  above had
    condensed into a warm fog. Cautiously, Sam took a few steps into the  fog.
    It felt like taking a walk on a soft misty summer morning. With each step
    he took, the fog thickened, until the entire surrounding vanished. A gust of
    wind cleared the fog, allowing crystal-clear sunshine to filter in.
</p>
<p>
    Sam couldn't believe it. It just felt like moments ago that  it had been 4
    PM. He glanced at his watch, only to be met with the display of  4:20 PM.
    Something was not right here. In a hurry to reach his house before his
    parents woke up, he turned back and ran, only to stop dead right in front of
    a  serene seashore.
</p>
<p>
    Sam stared at the sea in horror. There was no way the park  was anywhere
    near the sea, and yet here it was, the waves crashing across the sand
    making a rhythmic melody. At first, Sam thought that he was hallucinating,
    but  his watch had been working perfectly, keeping track of the time for
    him. There  was no way this was a hallucination. Everything felt so vivid
    and correct.
</p>
<p>
    Taking a few tentative steps towards the sea, he reached out  his hand
    towards the water. It was cool, wrapping around his arm comfortingly. He
    could hear the sand crunching around him. Sam swung around and came face to
    face with a figure wrapped in a thick coat. Their face was hidden by their
    hat  and scarf. Sam realized they were the same figure he had seen earlier.
</p>
<p>
    "Who are you, and how did you even get here," asked  the figure. "Did I not
    close the gate properly?"
</p>
<p>
    "You are the person I saw poking around the park,"  said Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "I was seen after all. Let me guess, you just followed  me in, without even
    thinking about the consequences?"
</p>
<p>
    An embarrassed "Yeah" was all that Sam could  muster.
</p>
<p>
    "That means you are stuck here for a week. I won't be  able to create a gate
    back to your world anytime soon."
</p>
<p>
    "If you can connect just my phone back to my world, I  should be able to
    send them a message. It's winter vacations, I can just say I  went on a trip
    or something," said Sam
</p>
<p>
    "That should be possible, yes," said the figure. "Catch!"  They took off
    their winter clothing and tossed it to Sam. Golden blond hair  peeked out
    from underneath his hat. The figure was a guy, who appeared slightly  older
    than Sam. He held his hands towards Sam.
</p>
<p>
    Handing his phone over to the guy, Sam watched him lift it and  chant
    something. Again, the same green glow filled the air near the phone, and
    Sam could see that the message he sent had gone through.
</p>
<p>
    "There you go," said Jade, handing the phone back  to Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "Thanks," said Sam. "I am just curious but,  what is this place and why did
    you even come to my world anyway?"
</p>
<p>
    "Allow me to explain," said Jade. "I study in  your world. Some people from
    here tend to study or work there. I came here for  the winter vacation to
    visit my family. I am Jade, in case you were  wondering"
</p>
<p>
    "Wait a second, does that mean you study at my  university?" said Sam
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah," said Jade. "I am a senior, so that  explains how we have not met
    each other over there. Do you see that tall  structure in the distance? That
    is where we are going. Come along then!"
</p>
<p>
    Hearing those words, Sam let himself be pulled along with  wherever Jade was
    going. He really wanted to see how different this world was,  from his home
    world. The structure loomed in the distance, towering over the  horizon like
    a tree. It vaguely resembled a tree with boxy shapes attached to  it.
</p>
<p>
    "How long until we reach whatever that is?" asked  Sam
</p>
<p>
    "We should be able to reach it by tonight," said  Jade. It is a week away by
    walk, but there are always shortcuts you know."  Jade smiled at Sam. "You
    shall experience my world with your own  eyes!"
</p>
<p>
    Sam looked at his watch. Nearly six hours had passed since he  first entered
    this world. The sky was beginning to darken, the softening of  shadows
    heralding a change. Jade stopped Sam, pointing to a cavern.
</p>
<p>
    "Here, follow me. There is a teleportation gate here,  which should lead
    straight to my city"
</p>
<p>
    Following Jade, Sam stepped into the dark cavern. A flare of  light lit up
    behind him. Jade had done something to create a glowing orb, that  was now
    following them around. Amazed, Sam reached out to touch the orb.
</p>
<p>
    "You might not want to do that," said Jade, who was  walking in front of
    Sam. "It will pull you in and compress you unless  that's your thing"
</p>
<p>
    Sam hastily pulled his hand back from the orb. "Weren't  you supposed to
    mention this a tiny bit earlier?
</p>
<p>
    "I am just joking," laughed Jade. "It just  goes out when touched, see."
</p>
<p>
    Jade reached out his hands and touched the orb. It vanished  with a hiss.
</p>
<p>
    "I think I would like the light back please," said  Sam. With a flourish of
    Jade's hands, the orb was back up again.
</p>
<p>
    Walking a bit further, they came across a large glowing gate  deep inside
    the cavern.
</p>
<p>
    "You step through this, and you are right there"
</p>
<p>
    Sam reached his hands towards the gate, and slowly pulled it  back without
    touching it. He was in a place with different rules from Earth and  did not
    know if anything or even anyone could be trusted.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't worry. This just directly takes you to the city,  with no chance of
    failure. Hold my hand. I shall go in first" Jade held  out his hand to Sam.
    Reaching out, Sam took the offered hand. Jade stepped into  the gate,
    smoothly dragging Sam to the other side.
</p>
<p>
    It was a giant tree all along. Sam stared at the sky trying  to gauge the
    tree's height, but the tree seemed to go on forever. There were many
    residences and a giant fortress, all constructed right into the tree. The
    rest  of the city sprawled from the base of the tree, and far away into the
    distance.
</p>
<p>
    "Welcome to the citadel of Kanara, my hometown and the  capital city of
    Aquaria!"
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  2
</p>
<p>
    The first time Jade saw Sam, he was standing on the beach, wandering  around
    aimlessly. Jade realized that someone had followed him and decided to  take
    him back to his city so that he could be sent back as soon as possible.
    Jade did not know what the immigration officials would say, but he hoped
    that  Sam could return without any trouble.
</p>
<p>
    Jade glanced at Sam, who was staring at the giant fortress,  entranced. He
    felt a glimmer of pride at his hometown being appreciated. The  second they
    entered the city a group of officials was waiting for them.
</p>
<p>
    "Looks like they did sense you enter after all,"  said Jade. "Just follow
    along with them. I shall take care of the  explanation."
</p>
<p>
    The officials led them to the giant tree. The base level was  a lounge room,
    which had a bunch of warp gates set up along the far end. Each  of the warp
    gates led to a different level in the tree. Many people were busy  going to
    different levels through the gates. The officials walked to a gate and
    motioned for them to enter.
</p>
<p>
    Sam held out his hand to Jade. Grabbing hold of Sam's hand,  Jade entered
    the warp gate behind the officers, pulling Sam along, just like  earlier.
    Jade was met with the familiar room of the transfer office, from when  he
    first applied for a transfer to Earth. The officials made them sit and
    started with their questioning.
</p>
<p>
    "So, how did you end up here anyway?" asked the  transfer head.
</p>
<p>
    "I saw a green glow and went to explore. That somehow  transported me here,"
    replied Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "Didn't you confirm that no one else was there  nearby?" This time, the
    question was directed at Jade.
</p>
<p>
    "I did," said Jade. "It was 2 AM, and I did  not expect anyone to be around.
    Not like our world's magic works there anyway,  apart from the warp device
    you gave." Jade took out a small cube from his  pocket and handed it to the
    head.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, this device will take a week to charge up  again," said the Head. "Is
    your friend over there in any hurry to  return? If so, we can try finding
    another device that is charged."
</p>
<p>
    "Nope," replied Sam. "I already sent a message  to my parents, so I won't be
    missed for a week."
</p>
<p>
    "That's good then," said the Head. "Just fill  this out, and we can clear
    you soon enough." The Head handed Sam a form.
</p>
<p>
    Jade peeked at the form. It was a generic personal details declaration
    form. Sam started filling in the details one by one. So that's his full
    name,  Sam Forger, Jade noted.
</p>
<p>
    Jade was shooed away by Sam, so he went back to looking  around the office.
    The Head was missing. It looked like the Head had gone to a storeroom
    behind the office. After a while, the Head returned with a strange
    wristband-like object. Jade could sense the magic coming off the wristband.
</p>
<p>
    "If you have finished the form, please keep it over  there," said the Head.
</p>
<p>
    Jade watched as Sam put the completed form on the table and  eyed the object
    in the Head's hand.
</p>
<p>
    "What is this for?" asked Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "This is a system to keep track of otherworld  visitors," said the Head,
    handing over the wristband to Sam. "Keep it  on at all times, unless you
    want to be imprisoned."
</p>
<p>
    Sam handed the wristband to Jade. "Do you think this is  safe?"
</p>
<p>
    "I have not seen one of these in use, as no one from  your world visits, but
    I have heard of such tracking systems being used,"  replied Jade. "It's
    probably like the passport system of your world."
</p>
<p>
    Sam reached out his hand to take the wristband, but Jade  deftly slipped the
    wristband on Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "Nice accessory you have there," said Jade with a  smirk. "Hold on, let me
    make it look like a normal watch." Waving his  hand over the wristband, it
    now started looking like an innocent watch.  "Just an illusion, but it looks
    better, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
    Sam glanced down at his hand, which had doubled in the number  of watches.
    "Now I have two watches, huh?"
</p>
<p align="center">
    ***
</p>
<p>
    Heading out of the office, Jade turned to Sam. "Now that  you're in the
    clear, it is time to visit my home. I live somewhere over  there," said
    Jade, pointing vaguely to a location beyond the great tree.  The streets
    were clear and lit with brightly glowing yellow orbs, outlining a  tall wall
    visible in the distance. "Follow me!"
</p>
<p>
    Jade walked along with Sam, pointing out different parts of  the city to
    him. "The entire area from the base of the tree to that wall  over there is
    the fortress of Kanara. And that is where we can exit the  fortress," he
    said, nodding towards a gate looming in front of them. The  gate was still
    open, allowing people in and out. "My house is just beyond  the fortress."
</p>
<p>
    "That is one giant gate," remarked Sam. Jade  noticed Sam looking at the
    fortress, trying to drink in all the sights of the  city. "Thank you for
    showing me all this, Jade."
</p>
<p>
    "It gets better," laughed Jade. "You must see  how beautiful the great tree
    looks in the morning. Oh, and the view from the  top floors is just amazing,
    you know?"
</p>
<p>
    Telling the tales of his city to Sam, they continued their  way to Jade's
    home. After a while, Jade stopped in front of a tall apartment  building.
    Entering it, he led the way to an apartment on the 6th floor.
</p>
<p>
    "Damn, this looks like an expensive apartment  block," said Sam, looking
    around the house. The modern feel of the house  seemed to impress him. "So,
    this is where we will be staying?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yup, my parents don't stay here, so it's fine."  Jade pointed to a room.
    "You take that guest room, and I shall stay in  mine. If at any point you
    feel scared, feel free to wake me up."
</p>
<p>
    "Thanks again, Jade," said Sam, going over to the  room and opening it. It
    was nice and spacious, with a light orb casting the  room with a soft glow.
    Sam leapt face-first on the bed. "I think I will be  able to sleep
    peacefully!"
</p>
<p>
    Leaving Sam to sleep, Jade retired to his room and sat at his  desk. He was
    unable to sleep. It had been half a year since he came back to his  house,
    not that he wanted to come here anyway. The empty house was a stark
    reminder of the fact that his parents had abandoned him a few years back.
    They  had divorced and left the house to him before running off to different
    cities.
</p>
<p>
    Ever since that day, he had worked hard to apply for the  transfer program
    so that he could leave the memory behind. Being back here gave  him a
    strange feeling. Thankfully, some of his friends from college were from  his
    world, so there was a chance they might visit. Then there was Sam as well,
    sleeping in the next room, so the house did not feel empty anymore.
</p>
<p>
    Walking back to Sam's room, Jade knocked. "Are you awake  Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah," a voice replied. "I am just processing  the events of the day. A lot
    of things happened huh?"
</p>
<p>
    Walking into the room, Jade sat on a chair, which was by the  bed.
</p>
<p>
    "Where are your parents anyway? This house is way too  big for a person
    living here alone"
</p>
<p>
    "They have moved on to their different paths" Jade  turned his face away
    from Sam. "Guess they got tired of playing  house"
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sorry for asking"
</p>
<p>
    "Nah, it's fine. I have had a long time to come to terms  with it anyway.
    Rest well then, we have a lot to see tomorrow!"
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  3
</p>
<p>
    The next day was bright and sunny, leading Jade and Sam to  wake up early.
    It was time for sightseeing at last. Sam couldn't wait to see  the city view
    from the higher levels of the great tree. He was glad he somehow  ended up
    here and met Jade. He just hoped that Jade wouldn't be punished somehow  for
    letting an outsider like him into this world.
</p>
<p>
    Sam could hear a soft bubbling noise coming up nearby. He  followed the
    source of the sound to find Jade preparing breakfast. It wasn't  anything
    like preparing breakfast on Earth. Jade was waving his hands and  chanting
    something. Food just started moving around, getting chopped, and  getting
    cooked all on its own.
</p>
<p>
    "How do you like it?" asked Jade. "This is how  we cook here, very easy! We
    can't make the food itself appear with our powers,  but it can be cooked in
    an instant."
</p>
<p>
    "Amazing! Is there any way I can learn such  powers?"
</p>
<p>
    "You have to be born in this world," said Jade.  "I do vaguely remember
    hearing about some ways for outsiders though."  Jade's face turned mildly
    pink. "Something about binding?"
</p>
<p>
    "Binding, hmm." Sam walked up to the food and  sniffed it. "Smells good!"
</p>
<p>
    After eating a pleasant and filling breakfast, Sam set out  with Jade to see
    the famous tourist sites of the city. There were not many  people this early
    in the morning, so the city was quite calm. As Jade knew a  lot about this
    city, he was able to provide a quick answer to any questions  that Sam
    asked. After walking back into the fortress, Jade made his way to the
    lounge of the great tree and beckoned Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "You wanted to see the view from the top, right? Well,  we really can't
    reach the treetop since no one has scaled it yet, but the  observatory floor
    should be reachable easily using the warp gates."
</p>
<p>
    Jade led Sam to a gate titled "Observatory Tower."  Below it was a notice,
    "Climb with care." Stepping in, they were  faced with a room, which had a
    set of stairs leading up above them.
</p>
<p>
    "All these advanced magical technologies and there are  stairs?" Sam looked
    at the stairs, puzzled.
</p>
<p>
    "I suppose it is there for the vibes," said Jade.  "Go on then."
</p>
<p>
    Climbing carefully behind Jade, Sam went ahead. The stairs  seemed to keep
    going on forever, going round and round in circles up a small  chute. After
    what seemed like a century, the stairs finally led to an exit. It  was a
    glass room directly attached to the side of the tree.
</p>
<p>
    Sam shakily stepped into the glass room. Below it stretched  the entirety of
    the city of Kanara. The light of the morning sun bathed the  city in
    golden-blue hues. Entranced, Sam went to the edge of the observatory  and
    stared at the city below. Jade came up behind him and stood right next to
    him.
</p>
<p>
    "Cool, right! Many years back, my father took me here  for the first time.
    The view now is just as stunning as it was back then. The  city did expand
    quite a bit, though."
</p>
<p>
    Sam continued looking at the city below, trying to spot  something
    interesting. Far beyond the city outskirts, he could see the  beginnings of
    something dark, something that was not lit by the rising sun.
</p>
<p>
    "What is that dark place over there?" asked Sam.  "It looks like a forest of
    some kind."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, that is the cursed forest," said Jade  casually. "It protects this city
    from any invasions, but yeah, if you get  stuck in there, you are not making
    it back at all."
</p>
<p>
    "Then how do people even leave this city anyway?"
</p>
<p>
    "Teleport gate is the key," said Jade. "There  is a gate at the outskirts of
    the city that bypasses the forest entirely.  Supposedly, someone found a way
    through the forest, so they just set up a  teleport gate once they got here.
    Want me to take you a bit inside it?"
</p>
<p>
    Sam shuddered. "No thanks, I don't want to get lost in  there forever."
</p>
<p>
    "No need to worry about that," said Jade. "I  still have the warp gate, so
    we can use that to get out. My friends will come  here tomorrow, so we can
    all go with them on a sightseeing trip."
</p>
<p>
    Trying to balance his curiosity and his fear, Sam considered  Jade's words.
    "If you can get us back, then it's fine, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
    Sam reached out to his phone to take some pictures, but Jade  stopped his
    hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Please don't," said Jade. "In case this  picture ends up in your world's
    network, it will cause a big problem. Go ahead  and use my phone. It is
    modified to be protected from external threats."
</p>
<p>
    Jade handed his phone to Sam. Throwing his arm over Jade, Sam  held the
    phone in front of them. "Smile!" With a click, the shutter  fired, capturing
    the picture of the duo with the city sprawling behind them.
</p>
<p align="center">
    ***
</p>
<p>
    By the time they left the observatory, it was almost  lunchtime. Many other
    people had started coming up to the observatory to view  the city below
    them. Sam's stomach grumbled, so he turned to Jade.
</p>
<p>
    "Know any good places to eat, Jade?"
</p>
<p>
    "That is where I am heading," teased Jade. "I  could feel the hunger
    radiating off you."
</p>
<p>
    Sam's face flushed. "I shall be ready to eat then."
</p>
<p>
    They walked up to a beautiful villa-like restaurant, stepped  inside, and
    approached the counter.
</p>
<p>
    "The usual, please," said Jade. "For the two  of us."
</p>
<p>
    Heading to the table, which was just cleared by the hotel  staff, they took
    a seat. The aroma of the cooking food wafted through the open  kitchen door,
    filling the room with an expectant smell.
</p>
<p>
    "This place smells really good," said Sam.  "What does the usual consist
    of?"
</p>
<p>
    "You'll see," said Jade. "All I shall say is,  it will be the best food you
    have ever eaten."
</p>
<p>
    Just then, the restaurant staff came over to the table,  carrying dishes of
    varying colours. They placed everything on the table in a  neat fashion.
</p>
<p>
    "Enjoy your food, sirs."
</p>
<p>
    The food did not look like anything from Earth. It was  different and had
    completely different fruits and meat that did not exist on  Earth. Sam
    looked at the food and hesitated.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you sure I can eat this? Seeing as I am from Earth,  after all."
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, it's fine, don't worry. Your world's food does  not do anything to
    us, so you should be fine too," said Jade. "Go on  then."
</p>
<p>
    Taking his spoon, Sam dipped it into a randomly selected  plate with strange
    meat and brought the food up to his mouth. A pleasant smell  immediately
    assaulted his nostrils. Upon taking a bite, Sam discovered it  tasted
    amazing. It reminded him of high-end cooked meat from back home.
    Immediately turning his attention to his other plates, he made quick work of
    it. Jade, who was watching him eat with a strange expression on his face,
    handed him a glass of water, barely able to suppress his laughter.
</p>
<p>
    "I told you it's the best," said Jade. "I come  here whenever I feel like
    treating myself. These guys really know how to  cook."
</p>
<p>
    After a while, Jade finished up his plate and called the  staff for the
    bill. Sam went forward to pay but realized his currency was of no  use in
    this world.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, don't feel bad, it's all transfer program money  anyway. Feel free to
    treat me when the next semester starts."
</p>
<p>
    "Of course," said Sam. "I know of some amazing  places back home myself."
</p>
<p>
    "I shall look forward to it then."
</p>
<p>
    Leaving the restaurant, they walked back to Jade's house. Sam  remembered
    Jade saying something about his friends arriving later that day.
</p>
<p>
    "You said your friends will be visiting?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah," replied Jade. "They will be coming to  the warp port in the evening.
    They sent me a message a while back."
</p>
<p>
    Jade handed Sam an open letter. Something was written there  in a script
    that was illegible to Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "Your language seems pretty interesting," said Sam.  "When were you sent the
    letter anyway?"
</p>
<p>
    "I just received it right now," said Jade. "We  don't have smartphones here,
    but messages can be sent by writing a letter and  transferring it directly
    to the person, wherever they may be. Look at  this."
</p>
<p>
    Jade took out a sheet of paper and handed it to Sam.  "Write a reply.
    English is fine, they are transfer students too, but not  from our
    university."
</p>
<p>
    Jade handed Sam a pen, with which he wrote a reply to the  letter. Handing
    the letter back to Jade, Sam watched keenly as Jade waved his  hand, and the
    letter disappeared.
</p>
<p>
    "There we go. They should have got the reply now."
</p>
<p>
    As the day passed, they lounged around the house, with Sam  asking Jade many
    questions about the world. Finally, it was almost time for  Jade's friends
    to arrive. Sending his friends a message to confirm the timings  once again,
    they slowly made their way to the warp port.
</p>
<p>
    Upon arriving at the warp port, Sam observed a lot of people  coming and
    going from the city. There was a small general check-in process  right after
    entering, but it was not as extensive as the ones back on Earth.  Jade was
    intently staring at the warp gate, waiting for his friends to come.  After
    some time, Jade pointed to a group of people. Sam could see two girls and  a
    guy making their way through the check-in and heading straight for Jade.
</p>
<p>
    "There they are! Those are the people who I did my  schooling with. All
    transfer students, as I said earlier. Sam, meet Ryan,  Emily, and Lydia!"
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  4
</p>
<p>
    At long last, Jade's friends had arrived. Jade could feel  their thoughts
    accusing him. After all, he had broken one of the most important  transfer
    student rules.
</p>
<p>
    "Let me guess, you saw Jade coming back here?" said  Ryan. "And managed to
    follow him?" Ryan held his hand towards Sam,  who was staring at them
    uncertainly. "I am Ryan, a friend of Jade. We all  were in the same transfer
    program batch."
</p>
<p>
    Shaking his hand, Sam introduced himself to the others.  Seeing things going
    along smoothly, Jade sighed a breath of relief.
</p>
<p>
    "So that's the tracking device huh," said Lydia,  noticing the band on Sam's
    hands.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah," said Jade. "Seems it acts like a visa  or something"
</p>
<p>
    "I see, so Jade, how was your past semester"  questioned Lydia. "Met any new
    people? Made any new friends? You always  had trouble talking to people.
    More importantly, finally met any girl you  wanted to date?" Lydia pinned
    Jade with her eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Jade pointed at Sam. "This is the answer to the first  part of your
    question. He is from my university. And for the second part of  your
    question, my answer remains the same."
</p>
<p>
    Emily burst out laughing. "You are the same as ever  Jade."
</p>
<p>
    Sam, who was chatting with Ryan about his university, turned  to the girls.
    "Yes, he has a new friend now, and I shall make him talk to  as much as new
    people as possible. In fact, I shall arrange for him to meet one  new guy or
    girl per day, his choice"
</p>
<p>
    Jade noticed Sam was good at interacting with people. Sam  could freely talk
    to the people he had just met. Picking up a piece of paper,  he crumpled it
    and tossed it accurately at Sam. "Hey, enough of  that!"
</p>
<p>
    Laughing, the group slowly left the warp port and headed back  to Jade's
    house. After settling their luggage at his house, they decided to go  to
    sleep for the night. Jade's house had three rooms. Ryan and Emily were given
    their own room, as they were dating. This left Lydia with her own room if
    Sam  shared Jade's.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, come on, you know I don't like staying alone in a  room, Jade," said
    Lydia. "Usually, me and Emily share the room."
</p>
<p>
    Jade thought about this for a bit. "Then, would you like  to stay with Sam
    and me? Someone must sleep on the floor in that case."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, please" in an instant, Lydia headed straight  to Jade's room. Jade sat
    on his bed and was going to assign Lydia to the floor  when Sam spoke up.
</p>
<p>
    "I shall take the floor, no worries," said Sam.  "You have a foldable
    mattress, after all, Jade"
</p>
<p>
    Jade could see the happiness radiating off Lydia's face.
</p>
<p>
    "Thanks a lot, Sam!" said Lydia, and started  heading for the bed, but Jade
    stopped her. Jade could not allow this to happen.  He had always known that
    Lydia liked him, but he could not give a concrete  answer to her feelings.
    With all the things that happened in his family, he was  very afraid of
    dating someone.
</p>
<p>
    "It's fine Sam, Lydia will take the floor. You are a  guest to this world. I
    can't have you sleeping on the floor, can I?
</p>
<p>
    A flash of annoyance passed Lydia's face. "Yes, you are  right Jade, I shall
    take the floor"
</p>
<p>
    Jade could feel Sam's confusion. After all, Sam would have  thought he was
    doing them a favour. They all settled in for the night, but Jade  was unable
    to sleep as usual. He decided to take a breather on the balcony. The  night
    sky was as beautiful as ever. In this world, it was much more colourful  and
    vivid, than back on earth.
</p>
<p>
    "Can't sleep again huh?" Jade heard a voice behind  him. It was Sam, coming
    up to check on him.
</p>
<p>
    "Sorry for waking you up"
</p>
<p>
    "It's fine, I was just going to ask, what is up between  you and Lydia
    anyway? I got the feeling she liked you, so I offered the  bed"
</p>
<p>
    "It's complicated," said Jade. "It's not like  I dislike her, but I don't
    know, I just can't date anyone right now."
</p>
<p>
    "Then why don't u reject her directly? Or at least let  her know"
</p>
<p>
    "It's not like she confessed to me" continued Jade.  "Besides, I don't want
    to ruin my friend's dynamics. Rejecting her will  make things awkward
    between us."
</p>
<p>
    "I see," said Sam, simply "Just tell her when  you are ready"
</p>
<p>
    Jade liked that about Sam. He was not the kind of guy to  judge someone,
    based on their decisions. He just accepted them for what they  were.
</p>
<p>
    "Sure will, one day"
</p>
<p align="center">
    ***
</p>
<p>
    The next day was bright and sunny. It was the perfect day to  explore the
    cursed forest. The name "cursed" was a bit of an  exaggeration. It was a
    famous tourist spot in that city. It was safe if the  established roads and
    fences were followed. Jade woke up to the sounds of  something cooking. He
    made his way to the kitchen and found Sam cooking. Lydia  was nearby,
    measuring out the ingredients.
</p>
<p>
    "It's time for breakfast, Jade!" Said Sam. "I  know how to cook, but the
    ingredients here are so different, so I had Lydia  help me out with the
    recipes"
</p>
<p>
    Once the entire group woke up, Sam started serving breakfast.  Jade found
    the breakfast to be amazing. Sam was a great cook.
</p>
<p>
    "So how is it, Jade?" asked Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "It is really amazing." Said Jade. "Especially  this fried stuff, see?" Jade
    forked a piece of the meat and brought it to  Sam's face. "Try it for
    yourself"
</p>
<p>
    Laughing, Sam ate the piece. "Thank Lydia too, she was  such a help with the
    recipe"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, thank me too, Jade," said Lydia with a smile.  "Somehow the food
    turned out really well heh"
</p>
<p>
    "You did well too, Lydia"
</p>
<p>
    After everyone finished their food, they started on their way  to the
    forest. As it was not a weekend, there was barely any crowd at the
    location. Jade immediately pulled Sam along to the stalls, which were
    selling  snacks. Lydia decided to stick with him, while Ryan and Emily
    decided to start  exploring the forest a bit ahead of the others.
</p>
<p>
    "That couple is going on a date huh," remarked  Lydia, staring at her
    friends slowly going deeper into the forest. "We  won't be able to see them
    for the rest of the visit, that's for sure."
</p>
<p>
    "They told us to meet up at the clearing," said  Jade. "They won't ditch us,
    don't worry."
</p>
<p>
    "It's not that, never mind," said Lydia. "Want  to explore a bit, while we
    wait for Sam to finish his food?"
</p>
<p>
    "That guy will surely get into trouble if we leave him  alone," said Jade.
    "He will be finished soon."
</p>
<p>
    With a pout, Lydia turned and started walking towards the  food stalls.
    "Think I am going to get something to eat too."
</p>
<p>
    After they were done, they started going deeper into the  forest. It was
    pretty, with a variety of different animals and birds, none of  them found
    on earth. After walking for a while, Jade pointed out a fence made  up of
    bushes to Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "Beyond this, are the unmapped areas," said Jade.  "If you cross them, and
    wander off, you won't be able to come back, unless  you remember the exact
    way you took."
</p>
<p>
    "Not like it's even crossable," said Sam.  "Just look at how thick and high
    the bushes are."
</p>
<p>
    "It's pretty easy for us, I will show you in a  while"
</p>
<p>
    The group slowly made their way to the clearing, taking in  the sights of
    the forest along the way. The second they reached the clearing,  they could
    see Ryan and Emily coming up to meet them, seemingly out of breath.
</p>
<p>
    "Made it here just in time, huh," said Lydia.  "Almost thought you guys
    won't show up"
</p>
<p>
    "We promised, Dia," said Emily. "Anyway,  onwards then!"
</p>
<p>
    "What do you mean, onwards? Asked Sam. "Looks like  the fences say
    otherwise."
</p>
<p>
    "You really think some fences would stop our Jade  here?" smirked Lydia.
    "Just watch"
</p>
<p>
    Jade circled the clearing, trying to find the spot, which he  had found back
    in his school days. It was his secret location, which he had  usually gone
    to when he was feeling down. After a bit of searching, Jade  stopped near a
    spot and raised his hand.
</p>
<p>
    "From the bottom of the earth, the trees grow and  die" chanted Jade.
    Immediately, the bushes parted, to make a clearing for  someone to pass
    through. Jade motioned for his friends to follow, and they all  slowly
    started walking in a single file behind him.
</p>
<p>
    "It has been quite a while since I stabilized this  path," said Jade.
    "Hopefully, it still leads to our secret  base."
</p>
<p>
    "The locations tend to shift around then?" asked  Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah" replied Jade. "Beyond the barrier,  there are no fixed maps or
    locations. It all depends on having a stabilized  path to certain locations.
    If you don't leave this path, you should be  fine."
</p>
<p>
    After following the path for a bit, the forest slowly started  thinning out.
    They could smell the crispy sea breeze right up ahead. The path  led them
    directly to the top of the cliffs. The evening sun lit up the cliffs  with a
    golden glow. Jade could see their base, which they had constructed back  in
    their school days. It was still standing, to Jade's surprise.
</p>
<p>
    "Is that the secret base you guys have been talking  about? Looks amazing"
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, we built it during one vacation," said Ryan.  "We usually stay here
    during our vacations. Come take a look inside!"
</p>
<p>
    The entire villa-like structure was built completely out of  wood. It was
    clear to anyone, that extensive magic was used in its  construction. Sam was
    gazing at the villa, awestruck.
</p>
<p>
    "Come on in then!" said Jade. "I hope this  place continues to remain
    standing"
</p>
<p>
    Going in, the group quickly headed to their rooms in the  villa. Each of
    them had their custom rooms, still untouched by anything. Jade  headed to
    his room, with Sam in tow. He could see his room, the same as ever.  His
    memories of coming here whenever things back home got bad, flashed through
    his mind. Sam put a soft hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "It's okay Jade, we all are here with you now. Why don't  we go to the beach
    then? It might cheer you up," said Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "In case you have not noticed, we are on top of a  cliff," said Jade. "How
    do you propose we get down?"
</p>
<p>
    "Knowing you guys, you would have already thought of something,"  said Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right!" said Jade. "Go get the others  and come with me"
</p>
<p>
    Making their way to the other side of the cliff, they headed  to a path,
    that was carved into the side of the cliff, which led down to the  beach
    area.
</p>
<p>
    "Did you guys do this too?" asked Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "This was all Lydia's doing," said Jade. "She  wanted to soak peacefully in
    the summer sun"
</p>
<p>
    "What's summer vacations, without beaches after  all," Running up to Jade,
    Lydia grabbed his arms. "Come on, let's  go"
</p>
<p>
    Heading down the path, they soon made their way down to the  beach. The
    water was as cold as ever in the summer heat. They quickly jumped  straight
    into the water."
</p>
<p>
    "Hey Jade, how do I look? Said Lydia, trying to show her  swimsuit off.
</p>
<p>
    "It's the same swimsuit you usually wear, so the same  Lydia as ever, I
    suppose," said Jade. This resulted in his face getting  splashed with cold
    water.
</p>
<p>
    "I am pretty sure even Sam can complement girls better  than you Jade," said
    Lydia. "Hey Sam, what do you think?
</p>
<p>
    "Looks nice on you" Sam smiled.
</p>
<p>
    "See!" said Lydia, splashing some more water on  Jade for extra measure.
</p>
<p>
    "Hey now, let's test his skills out some more"  exclaimed Jade. "How do I
    look then, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "You look like Jade," said Sam. Jade splashed some  water on Sam. With a
    laugh, Lydia swam away to talk with Emily.
</p>
<p>
    "Brr, I think I am getting way too cold," said  Jade. "I got splashed way
    too many times for my comfort."
</p>
<p>
    "You deserve it, you know," said Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "Fair enough"
</p>
<p>
    After they finished, they headed back to the villa and  relaxed there for a
    bit. They were originally planning to stay in the villa,  but Jade realized
    the government department tracking Sam wouldn't take kindly  to him going to
    an unreachable location for too long, so they decided to call  it a day and
    head back home.
</p>
<p>
    Heading back to the forested area, Jade and his friends  started making
    their way back. It was a bit dark, so they had to be careful not  to slip or
    stray from the path. They had almost made it halfway across when  Jade heard
    a yelp. Quickly spinning around, he could see that Sam was no longer  behind
    him.
</p>
<p>
    A jolt of fear struck him. Having magic made it easy to  survive and get out
    of this forest, but Sam had none. He immediately raised an  alarm.
</p>
<p>
    "Please search for Sam" Jade felt himself  screaming. "He can't survive in
    here without magic"
</p>
<p>
    "Calm down Jade," said Ryan. "It should be  pretty easy for us to find
    anyone."
</p>
<p>
    Using all their combined magic, they combed through their  immediate
    surroundings but found nothing. Jade could feel his panic rising.  After
    what seemed like hours of mindless search, a shout was heard from Emily.
</p>
<p>
    "I found him, he looks unharmed, no need to worry."
</p>
<p>
    All Jade's stress was released at once. Quickly heading to  the tree under
    which he was standing, he rushed to Sam's side and hugged him.
</p>
<p>
    "What happened, are you okay Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "I slipped on a root" said Sam embarrassed. I don't  remember exactly what
    happened after that, but somehow, I ended up near this  tree."
</p>
<p>
    With a look of horror,  Jade turned to Sam. "What do you mean by you don't
    remember?
</p>
<p>
    "My head might have taken a hit" Sam admitted.  "Anyway, I am fine now,
    don't worry, let's get going"
</p>
<p>
    Performing some healing magic on Sam, Jade grabbed onto his  hands. "Now,
    this will make sure you won't get lost again"
</p>
<p>
    They finally reached Jade's house. It was nearly midnight,  and everyone was
    extremely worn out from the ordeal. This was when Lydia spoke  up, her
    expression complicated and unreadable
</p>
<p>
    "I think it would be better if Sam leaves earlier. This  world is way too
    dangerous for him."
</p>
<p>
    "I am fine Lydia" Sam tried to interject, but Jade  cut him off. "Lydia is
    right, it's too dangerous for now, we shall bring  him back as a proper
    visitor later on, with the full magic protection provided  to visitors"
</p>
<p>
    "So, this is where my trip ends huh?" Sam's voice  held a note of
    disappointment.
</p>
<p>
    Jade looked at his friend, regret in his eyes. "Just for  now, Sam. It was
    fun having you around. We'll make sure your next visit is safe  and even
    more memorable."
</p>
<p>
    Sam smiled, nodding in understanding. "I'll hold you to  that, Jade."
</p>
<p align="center">
    CHAPTER  5
</p>
<p>
    Sam was feeling a bit down. His adventures in this world had  come crashing
    down abruptly. He could not even remember what happened when he  got lost in
    the forest. Sam felt alarmed about that, but he did not want Jade  to worry
    too much about him, so he acted like it was nothing big in front of  Jade.
</p>
<p>
    It was almost time for Sam to leave. They woke up early in  the morning,
    with Sam getting dressed and ready to go back to earth. They had  some nice
    breakfast, courtesy of Jade, as usual, and now Sam was standing at  the
    entrance of Jade's apartment.
</p>
<p>
    "I really have to go back now huh?" said Sam,  giving Jade one last pleading
    look. Jade just nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you worry, we shall get you back in no time,  through the proper
    immigration office. Will take a few months for processing,  but you should
    be back here by next vacation"
</p>
<p>
    "That's nearly half a year away" Sam groaned.
</p>
<p>
    "For what it's worth, I study in your same college, you  know"
</p>
<p>
    "Ah yes," Sam brightened up immediately. "I  shall come visit every day!"
</p>
<p>
    "Sure, sure" grinning, Jade pulled Sam along, and  the group of friends left
    the apartment. Sam noticed Lydia looking a bit pale,  but did not say
    anything.
</p>
<p>
    "Lydia, are you okay?" said Jade. "I noticed  that you were a bit down
    today"
</p>
<p>
    "It's nothing," said Lydia, a strange expression on  her face. "Don't think
    much of it"
</p>
<p>
    "If you say so"
</p>
<p>
    The group started walking towards the immigration office.  They could not
    use the warp port to travel between worlds. The only place that  controlled
    inter-dimension transport was that office, which had tagged Sam.  After a
    while, the familiar silhouette of the great tree came into view. Tinged
    with nostalgia, Sam started up the tree.
</p>
<p>
    It had been nearly a week since he had come to this world.  Sam had seen so
    many sights and experienced so many different things in this  world. He did
    not want to leave at all.
</p>
<p>
    "Who all wants to come see Sam off?" said Jade.  "They won't allow the
    entire group in for sure"
</p>
<p>
    "I will come," said Lydia.
</p>
<p>
    After saying their goodbyes to Sam, Ryan and Emily decided to  head to a
    shop nearby. Sam followed Jade behind, as they entered the great tree
    again. The portals glimmered away merrily in front of them as if inviting
    them  in. Stepping in, the trio were led to the immigration office.
</p>
<p>
    There were not a lot of people at this time of the day, and  they were
    ushered in quickly. The Head, who was sitting at the desk turned to  the
    group.
</p>
<p>
    "Why are you guys here, might I ask?" said the  Head. Recognizing Sam, he
    continued "Oh, hey Sam, how is this world?"
</p>
<p>
    "This is an amazing place" replied Sam. "I  don't think I shall ever forget
    this world"
</p>
<p>
    The Head avoided Sam's eyes. "You are going back?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yeah, Sam has to go back," said Jade.  "Something strange happened when we
    were out exploring. I think the magic  here is affecting him the wrong way"
</p>
<p>
    "I see," said the Head. "We could arrange for  a magic barrier next time, I
    guess. Say your goodbyes then, and we shall be  off.
</p>
<p>
    Lydia was staring daggers at the Head. Something was not  right, but Sam
    could not figure out what the problem was. Jade was just fussing  around,
    and telling Sam to meet him at the campus a while later. Giving Lydia a
    questioning glance, Sam turned to Jade.
</p>
<p>
    "Sure, goodbye Jade, goodbye Lydia, I shall meet you  guys soon enough."
</p>
<p>
    Saying that the Head led Sam to a device like the one Jade  had. While
    Jade's was not charged fully yet, this one was working perfectly.  With a
    chant from the Head, the box generated a glowing green portal.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on then, said the Head. That band will come off once  you reach Earth,
    so don't worry about it."
</p>
<p>
    Jade was waving at Sam. Waving back; he stepped through the  portal. The
    last thing he could see was Lydia reaching her hand towards him as  if to
    stop him from leaving
</p>
<p align="center">
    ***
</p>
<p>
    That was when Lydia broke down. She had been holding it in  for the past few
    days now. Something which she knew, that she could not tell  anyone. Jade
    stared at her with a confused expression on his face.
</p>
<p>
    "What, you were in love with him or what?"
</p>
<p>
    "I am so very sorry Jade. I knew what would happen from  the start" she
    sobbed. "Yet I was too afraid to say anything, too  afraid that you would
    act out recklessly."
</p>
<p>
    "Explain" Jade's eyes were like stone.
</p>
<p>
    "It's a policy we have here," chimed in the Head  with an unnerving
    calmness. "We erase the memories of people who come here  by mistake. It's
    to prevent information about this world from leaking."
</p>
<p>
    The blood drained from Jade's face. "What?" was all  he could muster, his
    voice trembling.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't bother bringing him back here, or trying to pull  something, or
    action will be taken against you."
</p>
<p>
    "How dare you not tell me this!" screamed Jade, his  voice cracking as he
    turned to Lydia. "Again and again, people are leaving  me forever." His
    words dissolved into sobs, the weight of loss crashing  down on him.
</p>
<p>
    "There was no way of escaping this, Jade," said  Lydia softly. "You could
    get expelled, or even have your memory wiped in  the worst case."
</p>
<p>
    "That doesn't mean you hide such an important thing from  me," said Jade,
    his voice raw with betrayal. "I thought you were my  friend. I thought I
    could trust you."
</p>
<p>
    Lydia's eyes filled with tears too. "I wanted to protect  you," she
    whispered. "I didn't want to see you hurt."
</p>
<p>
    "But you did hurt me," Jade replied, his voice  breaking. "You hurt me more
    than anyone ever has. How could you do this to  me?"
</p>
<p>
    Lydia reached out to touch his arm, but Jade recoiled.  "I'm so sorry," she
    said, her voice choking with emotion.
</p>
<p>
    Jade looked at her, his eyes filled with a mixture of anger  and despair. "I
    don't think you were ever my friend," he said.
</p>
<p>
    Lydia could understand Jade's pain very well, she had gone  through the same
    thing a year earlier. She wanted to shout and scream at Jade,  but her voice
    would just not come out.
</p>
<p>
    Getting irritated at the ongoing argument the Head, who hated  angst novels
    chimed in again.
</p>
<p>
    "Jade, did you consider that even Lydia might have gone  through something
    like this before?"
</p>
<p>
    Now it was Jade's turn to gape. "What"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes. One of my friend's memories got wiped. There is no  way to escape this
    got it?" said Lydia. "I understand this situation  more than you do. And you
    are such an asshole." She continued.
</p>
<p>
    Saying that, she grabbed Jade, and giving the Head one more  look for good
    measure, left the immigration office.
</p>

    FINAL  CHAPTER
</p>
<p>
    Jade could not give up. He was not like his parents who just gave  up on him
    and left. Even if the cost of getting caught was being expelled, he  had to
    try it. It was Sam, after all, someone who enjoyed this world with all  his
    heart. They had become quite close in the past week, and now Jade could not
    imagine being away from his side.
</p>
<p>
    Now, the problem was finding a way to sneak away without his  friends
    noticing. Jade decided to wait for a few weeks. They were all leaving  back
    to their homes by then.
</p>
<p>
    The task lay looming before him, like a giant mountain. He  had to reach Sam
    and figure out a way to undo the spell, all without being  caught by the
    immigration department. He took out his teleportation device and  looked at
    it. This certainly was tracked by the department, Jade knew. So, he  had to
    sneak in and use one of their gates.
</p>
<p>
    Jade spent the next few weeks visiting places around the city  with his
    friend. He was sure that no one suspected he was planning something  this
    dangerous. He did receive a few suspicious glances from Lydia, but he was
    sure he could escape her soon enough.
</p>
<p>
    Soon, the day that they were leaving arrived. The group  packed up their
    things and headed to the warp port.
</p>
<p>
    "Goodbye then, Jade," said Lydia. "Don't do  anything reckless. You know
    what is the price clearly"
</p>
<p>
    "Sure," said Jade. "I promise"
</p>
<p>
    With a toss of her head, Lydia glanced at Jade. "Alright  then, we shall be
    off"
</p>
<p>
    Saying so, they all slowly entered the wrap port, vanishing  out of sight.
    Making sure all of them left, Jade decided to launch his plan  into action.
</p>
<p>
    Since it was still early in the day, he decided to use  invisibility magic
    to blend in with the crowd and make his way in. The sun was  just beginning
    to climb, casting a golden hue over the bustling marketplace. He  moved
    purposefully toward the great tree at the centre of town, its ancient
    branches stretching skyward.
</p>
<p>
    Finding a secluded spot, he began the incantation for the  invisibility
    spell. His heart raced with anticipation as the magical energy  gathered
    around him. Just as he was about to complete the spell, he felt a firm  hand
    clamp down on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    Startled, he spun around and found himself face-to-face with  Lydia. She
    shook her head and sighed, a mix of exasperation and amusement in  her eyes.
</p>
<p>
    "I knew you were planning to do something stupid like  this," said Lydia,
    giving Jade a pointed glare. "What did I tell you  again, right before I
    left"
</p>
<p>
    Jade watched all his plans crumble down right before his  eyes. The only way
    to escape this situation was to run before she could catch  up with him. She
    wasn't the type of girl to risk her future for chasing  hopeless dreams.
</p>
<p>
    "I am sorry, but this is something I have to do,"  said Jade, giving Lydia
    an open, honest gaze. "I won't be able to move on  then"
</p>
<p>
    Jade let Lydia ponder and continued his spell. If she did not  actively stop
    him, he could continue just as planned.
</p>
<p>
    "Let me come with you then," said Lydia, to Jade's  surprise. "I shall be
    your lookout"
</p>
<p>
    Jade could not understand this girl. Just a moment ago, she  told him not to
    do anything reckless, and now she was roping herself into his  stupid plan.
    Jade gave Lydia a questioning look.
</p>
<p>
    "Just think of it as something I have to atone  for," said Lydia with a
    mysterious smile, her eyes betraying the true  meaning.
</p>
<p>
    Jade understood now. Guilt had been eating her up from the  time she lost
    her friend. This was probably an attempt to soothe at least some  of that.
</p>
<p>
    "Fine by me," said Jade. "If we get caught,  feel free to blame me or
    something"
</p>
<p>
    With a defeated sigh, Lydia turned to Jade. "Don't be  silly, let's get
    going now"
</p>
<p>
    Expanding the area of the invisibility spell to cover Lydia,  they joined
    the long line of people who were heading inside the great tree.  Once again,
    multiple portals stood before them, swirling with shimmery colours,  just
    like before. Making sure no one noticed, they quietly slipped into the
    portal which led to the ministry of immigration.
</p>
<p>
    The forlorn corridor greeted their eyes once again, a place  that held an
    eternity of longing and despair. Going forward, they quickly  searched the
    dimly lit place, their eyes scanning for any hint of the portal  that would
    lead back to Earth.
</p>
<p>
    They pressed forward, their footsteps echoing through the  corridor. At long
    last, they happened upon a door guarded by a bunch of power  magic users.
</p>
<p>
    "This is it" whispered Jade, without looking at  Lydia. "Time to show them
    what we have got"
</p>
<p>
    With a whispered chant, a soft, silky spell spread out from  Jade and Lydia,
    their combined power making the spell enormously strong. It  caressed the
    mages, lulling them into sweet sleep. Taking the chance, Jade  quickly
    calibrated the location of the portal, and together, they jumped right  into
    it.
</p>
<p>
    Right after exiting the portal, the vast landscape of Inazuma  came into
    view. The city, which was previously covered in a thick blanket of  snow,
    had slowly thawed out, and patches of green could be seen.
</p>
<p>
    "So, what's the plan now Jade?" questioned Lydia.  She had been silent up
    until now, lost deep in her thoughts.
</p>
<p>
    "My plan is simple," said Jade. "We find Sam's  house, drag him back to our
    world, and reset the memory wipe by using a  spell."
</p>
<p>
    Lydia's face took on a dubious expression. "Easier said  than done, but
    let's see"
</p>
<p>
    "Either way, I prepared a good number of magic crystals  in my bag, so I
    might be able to reset the memory wipe from just touching  him"
</p>
<p>
    "Ok, that is a solid plan, I did not expect that from  you, Jade" A clear
    note of laughter escaped from Lydia.
</p>
<p>
    An expression of pride crept up Jade's face. "Of course,  I came prepared!"
</p>
<p>
    They slowly started walking towards the college where Jade  studied. Jade
    had no idea where Sam lived, so that posed a tiny problem which  he had to
    solve. He planned to get the address from his college records.
</p>
<p>
    Raiden University was a world-famous university in which  people from across
    the world studied. Tall buildings dotted the vast area in  which the
    university was located, giving an impression of a miniature city. No  sooner
    than Jade took a step in, however, he felt an ominous pressure on him.
</p>
<p>
    "JADE" Lydia screamed. "We have been found  out" Lydia's arms were held back
    by 2 magic users, who had teleported  right behind them, her face contorting
    in pain.
</p>
<p>
    "Leave Lydia out of this," said Jade with a harsh  look. "I forced her to
    come here, and want to be the only one to take the  punishment"
</p>
<p>
    With a look of indignation, Lydia started to speak up, only  to find that
    she could not. It was Jade's magic, preventing her from speaking.  The mages
    holding Lydia stared at Jade and released their grip on Lydia. Taking
    Lydia's teleport cube, Jade opened the gate and pushed Lydia in using his
    magic. All she could do was stare as Jade's magic pushed her away, without
    even  a chance of resisting.
</p>
<p>
    "Now then," said one of the mages. "Back to  the business at hand. You are
    under arrest for trespassing, travelling without  a permit and information
    leak. This will usually end up with life imprisonment,  but since you are an
    honour student, if you don't resist, you could get away  with just your
    transfer permit being revoked, and being put in a new university  in
    Aquaria.
</p>
<p>
    So, this was where all of Jade's plans ended. He thought  maybe he could go
    a bit further, but it was futile, he supposed. At least he  had a backup
    plan, he could manage a few years and try coming back here to find  Sam
    again, once he graduated.
</p>
<p>
    "Will I be ever allowed to visit Earth at all?"
</p>
<p>
    "If you are thinking of coming back here, forget  it," said the mage. You
    will be permanently banned from coming here."
</p>
<p>
    "And here I was, planning to listen to you guys" A  sour expression marred
    Jade's face. "At least this settles things for  me"
</p>
<p>
    "So that's what you choose huh?" a gentle and sad  look crossed on the
    mage's face.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," said Jade. "I will remain here to find  Sam."
</p>
<p>
    Slowly shaking his head, the mage replied. "Do what you  want then, let it
    be known that you are officially exiled from your world. The  second you
    come there, you will be hunted and tried for your crimes"
</p>
<p>
    "I am fine with those terms; I came prepared after  all"
</p>
<p>
    Saying so, Jade watched the figures of the mages slowly fade  away into the
    distance, as they headed for the gate to go back.
</p>
<p>
    "They did not confiscate my backpack huh? Good enough I  guess"
</p>
<p>
    Once he found the address of Sam's house, it was easy for  Jade to track his
    location. He just had to get Sam away from people and  activate the reversal
    spell.
</p>
<p>
    The opportunity presented itself to Jade, when he saw Sam  heading out of
    his house, and decided to follow him. With all preparations  ready, and his
    magic sources checked, he steeled himself to defy every rule of  his word
    for Sam.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps to Jade, this was what love was, never letting  someone go.
</p>
<p align="center">
    EPILOGUE
</p>
<p>
    It had been a confusing month for Sam. It was supposed to be  holidays, but
    he had wasted it working at the family shop run by his grandpa  for an
    entire week. He had no idea why he did that. They weren't that close, to
    begin with. His parents had not made him work either, so he just could not
    understand what happened. On top of that was this nagging feeling that he
    was  forgetting something, but just could not recall what.
</p>
<p>
    He had been searching for something, someone, but he just did  not remember
    what it was.
</p>
<p>
    Sam stared at his phone again. Contained within was the  message that he had
    sent to his parents nearly three weeks back. Why had he  even sent this
    again? The memory behind that message was very blurry. He could  not confirm
    with his grandpa either, as he was out of town for a while.
</p>
<p>
    To clear his mind, Sam decided to take a walk. There was this  park that he
    usually went to when he was feeling down. It was just about to be  night.
    The streetlights were slowly flickering into action, casting a pale  orange
    glow illuminating the road in front of Sam. The sun slowly faded out,
    leaving Sam alone with the cold breeze that was exploring the town.
</p>
<p>
    Sam headed straight for the empty swings; the echoes of the  playing
    children were absorbed by the park.
</p>
<p>
    Pondering his thoughts for a while, Sam could see a figure  moving around in
    the bushes. Sam turned on his torch and headed straight for  the figure.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you lost perhaps?" said Sam.
</p>
<p>
    A bright flash of light lit the surroundings. When it  cleared, Sam saw a
    sight he could never forget for as long as he lived. Bright  green eyes, and
    golden hair. The face looked at him with such absolute love,  that it made
    Sam feel like the cold of the park was melting away, replaced with
    something much warmer inside him.
</p>
<p>
    "I have come for you at last, Sam!"
</p>
